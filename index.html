Due to the number of slaves, the population was soon majority black, a proportion that continued for decades. In the 21st century, the population has a slight white majority, but blacks make up more than 46% of the residents, which results in highly competitive politics.  </p>

<p>A large Democratic majority was ardently split into a "town or country" dichotomy at the local level. Further, the county was split between Union and Confederate sympathizers, with deep grudges being held by both sides for grievances committed during the opposite's rule during the war. After the war, Republicans controlled local government and the Democrats controlled the county economy. The political situation and cultural differences kept tensions high between the groups, occasionally resulting in violence. The most violent episode came to be known as the Pope County Militia War, a six month drama involving robbery, plundering and murder.

<h1 id="Placer County,_California"><a href = "Placer_County,_California.html">Placer County, California</a></h1>
<p>Gold mining was a major industry through the 1880s, but gradually the new residents turned to farming the fertile foothill soil, harvesting timber and working for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Auburn was settled when Claude Chana discovered gold in Auburn Ravine in May 1848 and later became a shipping and supply center for the surrounding gold camps. The cornerstone of Placer's beautiful and historic courthouse, which is clearly visible from Interstate 80 through Auburn, was laid on July 4, 1894. The building itself was renovated during the late 1980s and continues to serve the public today with courtrooms, a historic sheriff's office and the Placer County Museum. Roseville, once a small agricultural center, became a major railroad center and grew to the county's most populous city after Southern Pacific Railroad moved its railroad switching yards there in 1908.  </p>

<h1 id="Wayne County,_Georgia"><a href = "Wayne_County,_Georgia.html">Wayne County, Georgia</a></h1>
<p>Seventy years after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General">General</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Oglethorpe">James Oglethorpe</a> settled the colony of Georgia and 27 years after that colony became one of the 13 original states, Wayne County came into being.  It was created by an Act of the Legislature in 1803 after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Treaty">Wilkinson Treaty</a> was signed with the Creek Indians on January 16, 1802, which ceded part of the Tallassee Country and part of the lands within the forks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oconee_River">Oconee</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocmulgee_River">Ocmulgee</a> Rivers to the United States.  As originally laid out, the new county – the 28th Georgia county – was a long narrow strip of land approximately 100 mi in length but with varying measures of width along the way.  It was six miles (10&nbsp;km) as it stood just south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamaha_River">Altamaha River</a>, eight miles (13&nbsp;km) wide near the Satilla and five miles (8&nbsp;km) wide at a location about 27 mi south of the Altamaha.  All counties organized prior to 1802 were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/headright">headright</a> counties – no surveys were ever made of those counties.  It was found that under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/headright">headright</a> system more land was given away than actually existed and this was the case for Wayne County.  Although created in 1803, no valid lottery was done for the county until the Land Lottery Act of 1805.  The 1805 Act divided the half million acres (2,000&nbsp;km²) of Wayne County, formed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallassee_Strip">Tallassee Strip</a>, and set the stage for the land lottery that would result in more formal settlement of the area.  It is the second date, December 7, 1805, that the county chose to observe as the creation date.  The area was not a popular one for lottery draws as the straws were drawn sight unseen and the winner was as likely to draw swampland as he was prime agricultural lots.  Being close to the coast and bordered by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamaha_River">Altamaha River</a>, Wayne County's history includes occupation by Spanish missionaries at the time of the settlement of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Augustine">Saint Augustine</a> as well as short lived French occupation.

The county was originally settled by "Yankees" (immigrants from New England and the western part of New York descended from the English Puritans whose ancestors settled New England in the colonial era).  The New England settlers founded the five towns of Andover, Wethersfield, Geneseo, Morristown and La Grange.  Before 1843, the land where Cambridge is currently located was the private property of a man named Rev. Ithamar Pillsbury, who was very well known amongst the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee">Yankee</a> settlers who were moving to Henry County in large numbers at that time.  Reverend Pillsbury deeded a large portion of his land to the town council and they immediately agreed it was a good place to lay out a town.  Lots were sold to incoming migrants and on June 9 of 1843 (after some quarreling among the town founders about how to finance it) construction began on the town.  Roads were laid out, post routes established, public buildings erected and people were invited to move there.  The original settlers were entirely of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> origins or were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee">Yankee</a>s from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upstate_New_York">upstate New York</a> whose families had moved to that place from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> only one generation earlier, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War.

The completion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal">Erie Canal</a> caused a surge in New England immigration to what was then the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territory">Northwest Territory</a>.  The end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War">Black Hawk War</a> led to an additional surge of immigration, once again coming almost exclusively from the six <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> states as a result of overpopulation combined with land shortages in that region.  Some of these later settlers were from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upstate_New_York">upstate New York</a> and had parents who had moved to that region from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> shortly after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">Revolutionary War</a>.

<h1 id="Sac County,_Iowa"><a href = "Sac_County,_Iowa.html">Sac County, Iowa</a></h1>
<p>Sac County was formed on January 15, 1851.  It was named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk_people">Sauk people</a>, formerly referred to as the Sac Indians. Sac City was appointed the county seat in 1856, and the first Sac County Courthouse was erected in 1862. The courthouse served its purpose well until 1873 when citizens of Sac County realized the county had outgrown the tiny building. Thus, a second courthouse was built. The building was eighty-five feet by fifty-six feet, a beautiful building of brick with limestone foundations and an impressive tower on the top. It was declared to be one of the best county buildings in Iowa. This courthouse was first used in January 1874, and the old courthouse was sold shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, in 1888 a prisoner set fire to the jail attached to the courthouse while attempting to escape, and both buildings were destroyed. Sac City erected a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sac_County_Courthouse">third courthouse</a> at a cost of thirty thousand dollars. This courthouse has been in use since with minimal structural changes, except for an extensive addition which was completed in the 1980s.  </p>

When the state legislature created Claiborne Parish out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchitoches_Parish,_Louisiana">Natchitoches Parish</a> in 1828, all governmental business, including court, began being held in the Murrell house.

<h1 id="Sabine Parish,_Louisiana"><a href = "Sabine_Parish,_Louisiana.html">Sabine Parish, Louisiana</a></h1>
<p>Boundary disputes followed the purchase.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Ground_(Louisiana)">Neutral Ground</a> Treaty was affected in 1806, declaring the area "Sabine Free State," a demilitarized zone, which became the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Ground_(Louisiana)">neutral strip</a> for outlaws, desperadoes, criminals and filibusters.

<p>Tensas Parish was the home to many succeeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</a> groups in the thousands of years before European settlements began. Village and mound sites once built by these peoples have now become archaeological sites. One example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowery_Mound">Flowery Mound</a>, a rectangular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/platform_mound">platform mound</a> just east of St. Joseph measuring 10 ft in height and 165 ft by 130 ft at its base and a summit measuring 50 ft square. Core samples taken during investigations at the site have revealed the mound was built in a single stage and because the fill types can still be differentiated it suggests the mound is relatively young. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal found in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midden">midden</a> under the mound reveals that the site was occupied from 996–1162 during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Creek_culture">Coles Creek period</a>.

The native word ''houma'' means red, and the tribe's war emblem was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crawfish">crawfish</a>. Historians say the Houma were related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskogean">Muskogean</a>-speaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, and migrated into the area from present-day Mississippi and Alabama. They first settled near what is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge">Baton Rouge</a>. After many conflicts with other Indian tribes, and losing a war to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_people">Tunica</a> in 1706, to escape the encroachment of Europeans, the Houma Indians continued moving south to more remote areas in the bayous. They settled in present-day Terrebonne Parish in the mid to late eighteenth century. They established a camp known as Ouiski Bayou on the high ground northwest of what later developed as downtown Houma. They were subsequently pushed from the highlands of the north to the coastal regions of the south by the European settlements in the late 1700s and 1800s.

<h1 id="Vernon Parish,_Louisiana"><a href = "Vernon_Parish,_Louisiana.html">Vernon Parish, Louisiana</a></h1>
<p>On March 30, 1871, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_Legislature">General Assembly</a> passed an act designating the creation of Vernon Parish, by taking territory from the parishes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchitoches_Parish,_Louisiana">Natchitoches</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapides_Parish,_Louisiana">Rapides</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_Parish,_Louisiana">Sabine</a>. While there seem to be four stories surrounding the naming of the Parish, only one is affirmed officially by the State which is that it was named in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon_(plantation)">Mt. Vernon</a>, the home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a>.  Other stories, though folklore, are: 1) that it was named after a race horse owned by Joe Moore, one of the members of the committee chosen to name the parish, who claimed that by naming the parish after his fast horse the committee would insure the growth of the parish to be as fast as his horse:  2) that it was named after a popular teacher who had been an officer in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal Navy</a>, only mentioned as "Mr. Vernon".  This was not to honor him, but to avoid disputes among the parish founders whom each wanted to name the parish after themselves. The final story is similar to the first and claims that the committee had been arguing over the name while drinking in a store, and in an attempt to preserve his precious whiskey and profits, the host suggested the committee stop a local man with a mule pulling a cart and that they should name the parish whatever the man said.  The man answered them "I calls him Vernon, 'cause he's the fastes' mule in de country."  Originally the area comprising Vernon was a part of a tract of land that was in dispute between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>, this land was called the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Strip_(Louisiana)">Neutral Strip</a>". As a result of this dispute the area became a haven for outlaws. Prior to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> in 1803, the only persons who came to the area were a few French and Spanish settlers.  It was also during this period that Dr. Burr established the community of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_Ferry">Burr Ferry</a>.  This community was known as the "Gateway to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</a>".

Previously, Old Baltimore County was more known as a geographical entity than a political one, with its territorial limits consisting of most of northeastern Maryland, then the northwestern frontier of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Maryland">Province</a> and included the present day jurisdictions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_City">Baltimore City</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_County,_Maryland">Cecil</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harford_County,_Maryland">Harford Counties</a>, as well as parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_County,_Maryland">Carroll</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Arundel_County,_Maryland">Anne Arundel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_County,_Maryland">Frederick</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_County,_Maryland">Howard</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County,_Maryland">Kent Counties</a>. In 1674, a proclamation of the Proprietor, established the then extensive boundary lines for old Baltimore County. Over the next century, various segments of the Old County were sliced off as population and settlements increased in the fringe regions so as to have a shorter distance to newly established county seats with their courts and commercial businesses.  </p>

From the waters of this county, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/watermen">watermen</a> have brought oysters, crabs, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrapin">terrapin</a>.  Migrating waterfowl overwinter here, and hunting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Goose">geese</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mallard">ducks</a> has been an important part of the county's history.

The actual date of establishment is, like many other dates, connected to genealogy. There is a conflict of opinion as to the exact year depending on the preferred source. The year 1735, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodspeed_Publishing">Goodspeed</a>'s ''History of Southeast Missouri'', and most of the descendants of the early settlers, is the most generally accepted date. Dr. Carl J. Ekberg, in his book, ''Colonial Ste. Genevieve'', is of the opinion that the date of the establishment of Ste. Genevieve is closer to 1750, based on interpretations of early letters, maps, and Catholic Church documents. Regardless of which date one wishes to believe, Ste. Genevieve is about 250 years old.   </p>

<p>Union County, was created by an act of the territorial legislation in 1893 and was officially recognized on January 1, 1894, when the first slate of elected county officials received their oaths of office. The county is named “Union” because the citizens were united in their desire for the creation of a new county out of three existing New Mexico counties. Union County was subsequently “carved up” by the creation of additional counties, Quay in 1903 and Harding in 1920. At one time, Union County had a population of over 20,000. There were a number of bustling communities such as Amistad, Hayden, Sedan, Pasamonte, Gladstone, Mt Dora, Grenville, Des Moines, Folsom and Dedman (now known as Capulin).  </p>

<h1 id="Carteret County,_North Carolina"><a href = "Carteret_County,_North_Carolina.html">Carteret County, North Carolina</a></h1>
<p>The first male of English parents born in the current area of North Carolina was John Fulford. He was born in 1629 in what is now Carteret County, North Carolina. He settled in this area and died in 1729. An article dated Sept. 18, 1893, in ''The New Bern Daily Journal'', identified Fulford's grave in a cemetery outside Beaufort, NC, in an area called the Straits, “bricked up with English brick.” In 1971 a survey by the Carteret County Historical Society found such a grave in the Fulford Cemetery off Piper Lane in Gloucester.  There is an unmarked bricked up grave matching this description today. One of the more profound families from Carteret County was the Dennis family. William Dennis Sr. (b.1720 d. 1800) was an extremely colorful landowner, Revolutionary War officer and overall defender of the county of Carteret. In 1747, William Dennis assisted with the successful defense of the county during the War of Jenkins' Ear (fighting against Spanish pirates). Perhaps William Dennis' greatest contribution to Carteret County was his service during the Revolutionary War. William was promoted to Captain in the 8th North Carolina Regiment stationed at Valley Forge in November of 1777. William also participated in the Battle of Brandywine. At the ripe age of 60, William was a Major in the Carteret County Militia. In 1782, William assisted with driving the British from Carteret County alongside Col. John Easton. William was once an owner of the famous Hammock House. By the year 1790, William was shown as one of the largest land owners in the county. Branches of the Dennis family include the Bell's, Watson's and Pelletier's, many of whom continued to live in the area for many years to follow. Some branches of this family later migrated to both Mississippi and Texas.  </p>

<p>French-Canadian fur trappers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson’s_Bay_Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> gave the name Riviere des Chutes (River of the Falls) to the Deschutes River, from which the county derived its name.</p>
<h1 id="Douglas County,_Oregon"><a href = "Douglas_County,_Oregon.html">Douglas County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>The area originally was inhabited by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpqua_(tribe)">Umpqua</a> Indians, who speak a language in the Athabaskan  language family (although some linguists put it in the Penutian family). Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_River_Indian_War">Rogue River Indian War</a> in 1856, most of the remaining natives were moved by the government to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ronde_Indian_Reservation">Grand Ronde Indian Reservation</a>. However, seven families of Umpqua hid in the hills, eluding capture for many decades.  They are now Federally recognized as the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians. The tribe manages a small reservation in Canyonville, Oregon, and has a Casino/Hotel named Seven Feathers to represent the seven families who refused forced removal to the Grand Ronde Reservation.   </p>
<h1 id="Gilliam County,_Oregon"><a href = "Gilliam_County,_Oregon.html">Gilliam County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Legislative_Assembly">Oregon Legislative Assembly</a> created Gilliam County on February 25, 1885, from the eastern third of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasco_County,_Oregon">Wasco County</a> after residents complained that they were too far from their county seat in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalles,_Oregon">The Dalles</a>. The first Gilliam county seat was at Alkali, now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Oregon">Arlington</a>. The question of a permanent county seat was placed on general election ballots in 1886, 1888, and again in 1890, when voters chose to move the county seat to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condon,_Oregon">Condon</a>, known to early settlers as "Summit Springs." Once the question of the location of the county seat was settled, voters in Gilliam County proved reluctant to provide a courthouse in Condon. The county government operated out of a two-room house until 1903, when the county court appropriated money to construct a courthouse.  This courthouse burned down in 1954 and was replaced the following year with the current courthouse.  </p>
<h1 id="Grant County,_Oregon"><a href = "Grant_County,_Oregon.html">Grant County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>Grant County was established on October 14, 1864, from parts of old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasco_County,_Oregon">Wasco</a> and old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umatilla_County,_Oregon">Umatilla</a> counties. Prior to its creation, cases brought to court were tried in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalles,_Oregon">The Dalles</a>, county seat of the vast Wasco County. The great distance to The Dalles made law enforcement a difficult problem, and imposed a heavy burden on citizens who had a need to transact business at the courthouse. In 1889, more than half of the southern part of the original Grant County was taken to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harney_County,_Oregon">Harney County</a>. Also in 1899, a small part of northwestern Grant County was taken (along with parts of Crook and Gilliam counties) to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_County,_Oregon">Wheeler County</a>.  </p>

<h1 id="Hood River County,_Oregon"><a href = "Hood_River_County,_Oregon.html">Hood River County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>The first permanent settlers in present-day Hood River County filed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_Land_Claim_Act_of_1850">donation land claim</a> in 1854. The first school was built in 1863 and a road from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalles,_Oregon">The Dalles</a> was completed in 1867. By 1880 there were 17 families living in the valley. By the latter part of the nineteenth century farmers of Japanese, Finnish, German, and French ethnicity had settled in the valley.  </p>

<h1 id="Jefferson County,_Oregon"><a href = "Jefferson_County,_Oregon.html">Jefferson County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>Jefferson County was created on December 12, 1914, from a portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crook_County,_Oregon">Crook County</a>. The county owes much of its agricultural prosperity to the railroad, which links <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras,_Oregon">Madras</a> with the Columbia River, and was completed in 1911, and to the development of irrigation projects in the late 1930s. The railroad was completed despite constant feuds and battles between two lines working on opposite sides of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschutes_River_(Oregon)">Deschutes River</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="Josephine County,_Oregon"><a href = "Josephine_County,_Oregon.html">Josephine County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>The discovery of rich placers at Sailor Diggings (later known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo,_Oregon">Waldo</a>) in 1852 and the resulting gold rush brought the first settlers to this region. Several U.S. Army forts were maintained in the county and many engagements during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_River_Indian_War">Rogue River Indian War</a> (1855–1858) took place within its boundaries.  </p>

Originally it covered all of southern Oregon east to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and south to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a> border. When the Territorial Legislature created Lane County, it did not designate a county seat. In the 1853 election four sites competed for the designation, of which the "Mulligan donation" received a majority vote; however, since it was contiguous to the "Skinner claim" both became part of the new county seat known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon">Eugene</a>.  </p>

The boundaries were altered in 1851 and 1854 with the creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_County,_Oregon">Lane</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasco_County,_Oregon">Wasco</a> Counties. The county seat was originally located in Calapooia (later known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Oregon">Brownsville</a>), but in 1851 the Territorial Legislature passed an act establishing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_Oregon">Albany</a> as the county seat.

<h1 id="Marion County,_Oregon"><a href = "Marion_County,_Oregon.html">Marion County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>Marion County was created by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Legislature_of_Oregon">Provisional Legislature of Oregon</a> on July 5, 1843 as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champooick_District">Champooick District</a>, one of the original four districts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Country">Oregon Country</a> along with Twality (later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_County,_Oregon">Washington</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clackamas_County,_Oregon">Clackamas</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamhill_County,_Oregon">Yamhill</a> counties.

Its creation was a result of a petition earlier that year by businessmen in Portland complaining of the inconvenient location of the Washington County seat in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsboro,_Oregon">Hillsboro</a> and of the share of Portland tax revenues leaving the city to support Washington County farmers. County commissioners met for the first time on January 17, 1855. The county is named after the Chinook word for the "lower river", Multnomah and Matlnomaq being alternative, interpretive English spellings of the same word. In Chinook Jargon,  Ne-matlnomaq, means the "place of matlnomaq" or the (singular)Ne-matlnomag, "the lower river", from the Oregon City Falls to the Columbia river.  The explorer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clark_(explorer)">William Clark</a> wrote in his Journal: "I entered this river...called Multnomah...from a nation who reside on Wappato Island, a little below the enterence" (quoted from ''Willamette Landings'' by H.M.

<h1 id="Sherman County,_Oregon"><a href = "Sherman_County,_Oregon.html">Sherman County, Oregon</a></h1>
<p>Sherman County was created on February 25, 1889 out of the northeast corner of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasco_County,_Oregon">Wasco County</a>.

The northern end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Ronde_Valley">Grande Ronde Valley</a> was the first part to be settled. During the 1860s, population growth in eastern Oregon prompted the State Legislature to split <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umatilla_County,_Oregon">Umatilla</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_County,_Oregon">Baker</a> Counties from Wasco County in 1862.

<p>Pickens County was Cherokee Indian Territory until the American Revolution. The Cherokees sided with the British, suffered defeat, and surrendered their South Carolina lands. This former Cherokee territory was included in the Ninety-Six Judicial District. In 1791 the state legislature established Washington District, a judicial area composed of present-day Greenville, Anderson, Pickens, and Oconee counties, and then composed of Greenville and Pendleton counties. Streets for the courthouse town of Pickensville (near present-day Easley) were laid off, and soon a cluster of buildings arose that perhaps included a large wooden hotel, which served as a stagecoach stop. In 1798 Washington District was divided into Greenville and Pendleton districts. The latter included what eventually became Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens counties. A new courthouse was erected at Pendleton to accommodate the Court of General Sessions and Common Pleas, and soon thereafter Pickensville began to decline.  </p>

Cotton from the surrounding plantations was shipped through Columbia and later manufactured into textiles there. General William T. Sherman captured Columbia during the Civil War, and his troops burned the town and parts of the county on February 17, 1865. The U. S. Army returned on more friendly terms in 1917, when Fort Jackson was established, which is now the largest and most active Initial Entry Training Center in the U.S. Army.  </p>

<h1 id="Anderson County,_Tennessee"><a href = "Anderson_County,_Tennessee.html">Anderson County, Tennessee</a></h1>

Although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Holston">Treaty of Holston</a>, signed in 1791, was intended as a negotiation with the Cherokee to prohibit settlement of the area including what is today Anderson County, the treaty became ineffective as more settlers moved through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> from Virginia and North Carolina into Tennessee.  The flooding of white settlers into the Indian domain was cause for several skirmishes, which eased after the Treaty of Tellico in 1798 (with an origination point for relinquished land from the Cherokee being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellico_Blockhouse">Tellico Blockhouse</a>) allowed for greater ease in settling the area.  </p>

<p>When the City of Falls Church was incorporated in 1948, its boundaries included only the central portion of the area historically known as Falls Church; those other areas, often still known as Falls Church (although they lie in Fairfax and Arlington Counties), are considered here for historical reasons.  </p>
<h1 id="Franklin city,_Virginia"><a href = "Franklin_city,_Virginia.html">Franklin city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>The city of Franklin had its beginnings in the 1830s as a railroad stop along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_River_(Virginia)">Blackwater River</a>.

<h1 id="Galax city,_Virginia"><a href = "Galax_city,_Virginia.html">Galax city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>Galax was founded along the watercourse of Chesnut Creek which has provided an abundant water supply for the city as well as furnishing an early source of power.  The Norfolk and Western Railway extended a spur into the village, then called Blairs, with the first train arriving in 1904.  The town itself was incorporated in 1906. It was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galax">Galax</a>, an evergreen plant growing in the area. The railroad provided both freight and passenger transportation that facilitated the growth of industry and provided many of the necessities of life for the people.  The manufacture of furniture, textiles, mirrors, garments, and hardwood flooring formed the economic backbone for the area.  The processing of condensed milk also enabled many small farms to sell limited quantities of milk that were processed in Galax.  </p>

<p>Archaeological excavations at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas_Island,_Virginia">Pocahontas Island</a> have found evidence of a prehistoric Native American settlement dated to 6500 B.C.  This is in the early third of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_period_in_the_Americas">Archaic Period</a> (8000 to 1000 BC).  Varying cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years. When the English arrived in Virginia in 1607, the region was occupied by the ''<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appamatuck">Appamatuck</a>'', a significant tribe of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powhatan_Confederacy">Powhatan Confederacy</a>.  They were governed by a ''<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weroance">weroance</a>'', King ''Coquonosum'', and by his sister, Queen ''Oppussoquionuske''.  This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages">Algonquian</a>-speaking people later had a town at Rohoic Creek (formerly ''Rohowick'' or Indian Towne Run), on the western edge of present-day Petersburg.  </p>
<h1 id="Poquoson city,_Virginia"><a href = "Poquoson_city,_Virginia.html">Poquoson city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>The name of the city is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</a> word which roughly translates to "great marsh." The term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pocosin">pocosin</a>, with its varied spellings, was a term used by the area's inhabitants to describe a low, marshy, woody place covered by water in the winter, but dry in the summer. These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">Native Americans</a> were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_peoples">Algonquians</a>, a tribal group affiliated through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powhatan_Confederacy">Powhatan Confederacy</a>, and were hostile to the early settlers. A petition to have the name of the parish and river changed was an attempt to rid the language of all vestiges of Indian terms. However, "poquoson" has survived through the centuries and has become a proper noun used to designate the present city.  </p>
<h1 id="Portsmouth city,_Virginia"><a href = "Portsmouth_city,_Virginia.html">Portsmouth city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>Portsmouth is located on the western side of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_River_(Virginia)">Elizabeth River</a> directly across from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia">City of Norfolk</a>. In 1620, the future site of Portsmouth was recognized as suitable shipbuilding location by John Wood, a shipbuilder, who petitioned King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England">James I of England</a> for a land grant. The surrounding area was soon settled as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantation">plantation</a> community.  </p>
<h1 id="Radford city,_Virginia"><a href = "Radford_city,_Virginia.html">Radford city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>Radford was named for Dr. John B. Radford..</ref> Dr. Radford's home <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnheim_(Radford,_Virginia)">Arnheim</a> was listed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2002. Radford was originally a small village of people that gathered near the New River, which was a major draw to travelers for fresh water and food while traveling west.  The town had a major population increase in 1854 when the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad came through.  A large depot was placed at Lovely Mount because of its strategic positioning between the eastern and western parts of the state.  The actual station was not on Lovely Mountain, located on the southwestern side of town, but Lovely Mount was a known mountain and naming the station this would help people to remember the location of the depot.  The Railroad Depot caused the population of Radford to boom.  It also caused a major increase in the amount of trade and business in the area.  Radford became a railroad town.  The original name for Radford was Lovely Mount because of the location of the depot; the name was changed in 1891 to Radford. Radford, or at least the train station area, was called Central Depot because of its central location halfway between Lynchburg and Bristol, Virginia of the original railroad, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (later the Norfolk and Western Railway).  </p>

<h1 id="Roanoke city,_Virginia"><a href = "Roanoke_city,_Virginia.html">Roanoke city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>The town first called Big Lick was established in 1852 and chartered in 1874.  It was named for a large outcropping of salt which drew the wildlife to the site near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_River">Roanoke River</a>.  In 1882 it became the town of Roanoke, and in 1884 it was chartered as the independent city of Roanoke.  The name ''Roanoke'' is said to have originated from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages">Algonquian</a> word for shell "money".  This was also the name of the river that bisected it (probably where shells had come from) and the county.  The city grew frequently through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation">annexation</a> through the middle of the twentieth century. The last annexation was in 1976.  The state legislature has since prohibited cities from annexing land from adjacent counties.

<h1 id="Salem city,_Virginia"><a href = "Salem_city,_Virginia.html">Salem city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>The earliest history of Salem exists as archaeological evidence of Native American tribes from as far back as 8000 B.C. until the middle of the 18th century. Europeans first explored the area of Salem in 1671, when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siouan_languages">Siouan</a>-speaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutelo_people">Totero</a> people had a village nearby. Explorers Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam gave the area its first recorded name: Totero Town, after this tribe, who supplied them with a guide to help with further exploration. Fort Lewis, named for General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lewis_(soldier)">Andrew Lewis</a>, of what is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_County">Roanoke County</a>, was built west of the town in 1752. Salem's Andrew Lewis Middle School was named after General Lewis. Salem became a small settlement serving travelers on the Great Road (roughly the same path followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-11">US-11</a> and later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_81">Interstate 81</a> today) and was officially founded in 1802, receiving its charter in 1806.  It is not known why the town was named Salem; the most widely accepted explanation is that it was named to honor William Bryan, a prominent citizen, who had moved from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_New_Jersey">Salem, New Jersey</a>. Salem was attacked twice by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a>, but its Salem Flying Artillery is said to have fired the last Confederate shot at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appomattox_Court_House">Appomattox Court House</a> prior to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s surrender.  One of the city’s four elementary schools is named after African American scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Carver">G.W. Carver</a>. Before integration, this was the high school for African Americans in Salem.  </p>
<h1 id="Staunton city,_Virginia"><a href = "Staunton_city,_Virginia.html">Staunton city, Virginia</a></h1>
<p>The area was first settled in 1732 by John Lewis and family. In 1736, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Beverley">William Beverley</a>, a wealthy planter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merchant">merchant</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_Virginia">Essex County</a>, was granted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown">Crown</a> over 118,000 acres (478&nbsp;km²) in what would become Augusta County. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surveying">Surveyor</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lewis_(Virginia)">Thomas Lewis</a> in 1746 laid out the first town <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plat">plat</a> for Beverley of what was originally called Beverley's Mill Place. Founded in 1747, it was renamed in honor of Lady Rebecca Staunton, wife to Royal Lieutenant-Governor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Gooch,_1st_Baronet">Sir William Gooch</a>. Because the town was located at the geographical center of the colony (which then included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia">West Virginia</a>), Staunton served between 1738 and 1771 as regional capital for what was known as the Northwest Territory, with the westernmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courthouse">courthouse</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_North_America">British North America</a> prior to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">Revolution</a>. By 1760, Staunton was one of the major "remote trading centers in the backcountry" which coordinated the transportation of the vast amounts of grain and tobacco then being produced in response to the change of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain">Britain</a> from a net exporter of produce to an importer.  Staunton thus played a crucial role in the mid 18th century expansion of the economies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonies">American Colonies</a> which, in turn, contributed to the success of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">American Revolution</a>.

Originally known as Constant's Warehouse, for John Constant, Suffolk was renamed after Royal Governor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Gooch,_1st_Baronet">William Gooch</a>'s home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, a county in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Anglia">East Anglia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</a>. Before European contact, indigenous American tribes lived in the region for thousands of years.

<h1 id="Barbour County,_West Virginia"><a href = "Barbour_County,_West_Virginia.html">Barbour County, West Virginia</a></h1>
<p>The first white settlement in present-day Barbour County was established in 1780 by Richard Talbott – along with his brother Cotteral and sister Charity – about three miles (5&nbsp;km) downriver from the future site of Philippi. At this time the region was still a part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongalia_County,_West_Virginia">Monongalia County</a>, Virginia. The region had had no permanent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Indian</a> settlements and so conflicts with Native Americans were relatively infrequent in the early days. Nevertheless, the Talbotts were obliged to leave their homestead several times for safety and twice found it necessary to retreat back east of the Alleghenies, returning each time. No member of this eventually large family was ever killed by Indian attacks.  </p>
<h1 id="Berkeley County,_West Virginia"><a href = "Berkeley_County,_West_Virginia.html">Berkeley County, West Virginia</a></h1>
<p>Berkeley is the second oldest county in West Virginia. The county was created by an act of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> in February 1772 from the northern third of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_County,_Virginia">Frederick County</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">Virginia</a>). At the time of the county's formation it also consisted of the areas that make up the present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_West_Virginia">Jefferson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_County,_West_Virginia">Morgan</a> counties. Most historians believe that the county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norborne_Berkeley,_Baron_de_Botetourt">Norborne Berkeley, Baron de Botetourt</a> (1718–1770), Colonial Governor of Virginia from 1768 to 1770. West Virginia's Blue Book, for example, indicates that Berkeley County was named in his honor. He served as a colonel in England's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Gloucestershire">North Gloucestershire</a> militia in 1761, and represented that division of the county in parliament until he was made a peer in 1764. Having incurred heavy gambling debts, he solicited a government appointment and in July 1768, was made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governor_of_Virginia">governor of Virginia</a>. In 1769, he reluctantly dissolved the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> after it adopted resolutions opposing parliament's replacement of requisitions with parliamentary taxes as a means of generating revenue and a requirement that the colonists send accused criminals to England for trial. Despite his differences with the Assembly, Berkeley was well respected by the colonists, especially after he sent Parliament letters encouraging it to repeal the taxes. When Parliament refused to rescind the taxes, Governor Berkeley requested to be recalled. In appreciation of his efforts on their behalf, the colonists erected a monument to his memory which currently stands in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Virginia">Williamsburg</a>, and two counties were later named in his honor: Berkeley in present-day West Virginia and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botetourt_County,_Virginia">Botetourt</a> in Virginia.  </p>

This land, which they called Can-tuc-kee, was thought to be inhabited by ghosts of Azgens, a white people from an eastern sea who were said to be killed off by the Shawnee's ancestors.
