<p>Ventura County was historically inhabited by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumash_people">Chumash</a> people, who also settled much of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_County,_California">Santa Barbara</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo_County,_California">San Luis Obispo</a> Counties, with their presence dating back 10,000-12,000 years. The Chumash were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunter-gatherers">hunter-gatherers</a>, fishermen and also traders with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_people">Mojave</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokuts_people">Yokuts</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongva_people">Tongva</a> Indians. The Chumash are also known for their rock paintings and for their great basketry. Chumash Indian Museum in Thousand Oaks has several reconstructed Chumash houses (‘apa) and there are several Chumash pictographs in the county, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burro_Flats_Painted_Cave">Burro Flats Painted Cave</a> in Simi Valley. The plank canoe, called a ''<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomol">tomol</a>'' in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumashan_languages">Chumash</a>, was important to their way of life. Canoe launching points on the mainland for trade with the Chumash of the Channel Islands were located at the mouth of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura_River">Ventura River</a>, Mugu Lagoon and Point Hueneme. This has led to speculations among archeologists of whether the Chumash could have had a pre-historic contact with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesians">Polynesians</a>. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diachronic_linguistics">diachronic linguistics</a>, certain words such as tomolo’o (canoe) could be related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_languages">Polynesian languages</a>.
