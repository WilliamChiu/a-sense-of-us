<p>Tuolumne County is one of the original counties of California, created in 1850 at the time of statehood. Prior to statehood, it had been referred to as Oro County. Parts of the county were given to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaus_County,_California">Stanislaus County</a> in 1854 and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_County,_California">Alpine County</a> in 1864.   The county, and Sonora, have achieved some notoriety as the actual setting of Dale Koby's cult/underground classic, ''Campus Sexpot''; Sonora was given the name Wattsville in that novel.   The sequel, ''From Roundheel To Revolutionary'', also takes place primarily in "Wattsville".   See the Wikipedia page, '''David Carkeet'''.  </p>
