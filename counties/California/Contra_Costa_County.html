<p>In prehistoric times, particularly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene">Miocene</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_timescale">epoch</a>, portions of the landforms now in the area (then marshy and grassy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savanna">savanna</a>) were populated by a wide range of now extinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammals">mammals</a>, known in modern times by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fossil">fossil</a> remains excavated in the southern part of the county. In the northern part of the county, significant coal and sand deposits were formed in even earlier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_timescale">geologic eras</a>. Other areas of the county have ridges exposing ancient but intact (not fossilized) seashells, embedded in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sandstone">sandstone</a> layers alternating with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limestone">limestone</a>. Layers of volcanic ash ejected from geologically recent but now extinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volcanoes">volcanoes</a>, compacted and now tilted by compressive forces, may be seen at the site of some road excavations. This county is an agglomeration of several distinct geologic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrane">terrane</a>s, as is most of the greater <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>, which is one of the most geologically complex regions in the world. The great local mountain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Diablo_State_Park">Mount Diablo</a> has been formed and continues to be elevated by compressive forces resulting from the action of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plate_tectonics">plate tectonics</a> and at its upper reaches presents ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan_Assemblage">seabed rocks</a> scraped from distant oceanic sedimentation locations and accumulated and lifted by these great forces. Younger deposits at middle altitudes include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pillow_lava">pillow lava</a>s, the product of undersea volcanic eruptions.  </p>
