<p>San Mateo County was formed in 1856 after San Francisco County, one of the state's 18 original counties since California's statehood in 1850, was split apart. Until 1856, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s city limits extended west to Divisadero Street and Castro Street, and south to 20th Street. In response to the lawlessness and vigilantism that escalated rapidly between 1855 and 1856, the California government decided to divide the county. A straight line was then drawn across the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula just north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bruno_Mountain">San Bruno Mountain</a>. Everything south of the line became the new San Mateo County while everything north of the line became the new consolidated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">City and County of San Francisco</a>, to date the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consolidated_city-county">consolidated city-county</a> in California.</p>
