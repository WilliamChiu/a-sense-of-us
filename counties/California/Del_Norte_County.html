The first European American to explore this land was pioneer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedediah_Smith">Jedediah Smith</a> in the mid-19th century. He was the first European American to reach the area overland on foot in a time before the European Americans knew anything about such a distant territory. For him it was literally "Land's End" â€” where the American continent ended at the Pacific Ocean. In 1855 Congress authorized the building of a lighthouse at "the battery point" (a high tide island on the coast of Crescent City) which is still functioning as a historical landmark.  </p>
