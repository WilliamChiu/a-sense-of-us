<p>Kern County was the site of the Battle of San Emigdio, in March 1824, between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumash_people">Chumash</a> Indians of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Mission">Santa Barbara Mission</a> who rebelled against the Mexican government's taking over mission property and ejecting the natives. This battle with Mexican forces from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,_California">Monterey</a> under the command of Carlos Carrillo took place at the canyon where San Emigdio Creek flows down <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Emigdio_Mountains">San Emigdio Mountain</a> and the Blue Ridge south of Bakersfield near today's Highway 166.  It was a low-casualty encounter, with only four Indians killed, and no Mexicans; the surviving Indians were pacified and brought back to Santa Barbara in June 1824 after a pursuit and negotiation in which many were allowed to keep their arms for the return march over the mountains.  </p>
