<p>Before European immigration, the land now known as Montgomery County was covered in a vast swath of forest crossed by the creeks and small streams that feed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River">Potomac</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patuxent_River">Patuxent</a> rivers. A few small villages of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscataway_Indian_Nation">Piscataway</a>, members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_peoples">Algonquian</a> people, were scattered across the southern portions of the county. North of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Falls_(Potomac_River)">Great Falls</a> of the Potomac, there were few permanent settlements, and the Piscataway shared hunting camps and foot paths with members of rival peoples like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_Nation">Senecas</a>.  </p>
