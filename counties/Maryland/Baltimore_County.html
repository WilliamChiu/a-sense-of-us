<p>The earliest known documentary record of the county politically in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_State_Archives">Maryland State Archives</a> in the Hall of Records in the state capital of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland">Annapolis</a> is January 12, 1659, when a writ was issued on behald of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_General_Assembly">General Assembly of Maryland</a> to its sheriff and is considered by historians to be its official year of "erection" (founding/establishment date) among the now twenty-three counties of the State, as it assumes that a certain amount of organization and appointments in the middle 17th Century had already occurred. Previously, Old Baltimore County was more known as a geographical entity than a political one, with its territorial limits consisting of most of northeastern Maryland, then the northwestern frontier of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Maryland">Province</a> and included the present day jurisdictions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_City">Baltimore City</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_County,_Maryland">Cecil</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harford_County,_Maryland">Harford Counties</a>, as well as parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_County,_Maryland">Carroll</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Arundel_County,_Maryland">Anne Arundel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_County,_Maryland">Frederick</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_County,_Maryland">Howard</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County,_Maryland">Kent Counties</a>. In 1674, a proclamation of the Proprietor, established the then extensive boundary lines for old Baltimore County. Over the next century, various segments of the Old County were sliced off as population and settlements increased in the fringe regions so as to have a shorter distance to newly established county seats with their courts and commercial businesses.  </p>
