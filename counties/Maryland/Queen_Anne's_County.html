<p>Queen Anne's County has two hundred sixty-five miles of waterfront area, much of that being the shores of Kent Island, which stands out from the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay. From the waters of this county, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/watermen">watermen</a> have brought oysters, crabs, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrapin">terrapin</a>.  Migrating waterfowl overwinter here, and hunting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Goose">geese</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mallard">ducks</a> has been an important part of the county's history.  The first settlement in Maryland was on Kent Island in August 21, 1631, and included twenty-five settlers in a manor house, a fort, and other buildings.  The settlement was referred to as Winston's Island.  The first houses were built similar to log cabins.  Although the county has a number of properties on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Queen_Anne's_County,_Maryland">National Register of Historic Places</a>, the original settlement no longer exists.  One of the oldest towns still existing is Stevensville, earlier known as Broad Creek.  </p>
