<p>In 1642, the governor and council appointed commissioners for the '''Isle and County of Kent.''' This act appears to have led to the establishment of Kent County. In 1675, the first county seat was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Yarmouth">New Yarmouth</a>. The seat was briefly moved upriver to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaker_Neck,_Maryland">Quaker Neck</a>, and then to the site of modern Chestertown. Before the American Revolution New Town on Chester, now Chestertown, was a port entry for the counties of Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne's.  </p>
