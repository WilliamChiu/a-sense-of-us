<p>Mining operators in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Mountains">San Juan mountain area</a> of Colorado formed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_Owners'_Association">San Juan District Mining Association</a> (SJDMA) in 1903, as a direct result of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Federation_of_Miners">Western Federation of Miners</a> proposal to the Telluride Mining Association for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day">the eight hour day</a>, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Labor_Wars#The_eight-hour_day_becomes_an_issue">had been approved in a referendum by 72 percent of Colorado voters</a>. The new association consolidated the power of thirty-six mining properties in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_County,_Colorado">San Miguel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouray_County,_Colorado">Ouray</a>, and San Juan counties.
