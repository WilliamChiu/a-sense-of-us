<p>Baca County was created by the Colorado legislature on April 16, 1889, out of the eastern portions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Animas_County,_Colorado">Las Animas County</a>. Baca County was named in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pioneer">pioneer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_General_Assembly">Colorado territorial legislator</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Baca">Felipe Baca</a>.  Prior to 1880's there was little activity in the County other than along the Cutoff Branch of the Santa Fe Trail that crosses the extreme Southeastern corner of the County. The 1910's saw wet years and expansion due to the increase in acreage that could be homesteaded.  World War I also brought increased demand for agricultural products.  The arrival of the Santa Fe Railroad in 1926 created new towns and a population increase.  The DustBowl arrived in the 1930's.  This prompted soil conservation efforts by the Federal Government. Part of this effort was the purchase of cultivated land by the government to return it to grassland.  Today the U.S. Forest Service supervises 220,000 acres of Commanche National Grassland which was purchased in the 1930's. These areas include Carizzo Creek and Picture Canyon.  The Colorado Division of Wildlife maintains the recreational areas at Two Buttes Lake and Turk's Pond.  </p>
