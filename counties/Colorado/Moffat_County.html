<p>Moffat County was created out of the western portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routt_County,_Colorado">Routt County</a> on February 27, 1911.  The county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moffat">David H. Moffat</a>, a Colorado tycoon who died in 1911. His railroad, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver,_Northwestern_&_Pacific_Railway">Denver, Northwestern & Pacific</a>, attempted to build a route from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver">Denver</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City">Salt Lake City</a>. In 1913, a reorganized railroad, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_and_Salt_Lake_Railway">Denver & Salt Lake</a>, reached as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig,_Colorado">Craig</a>, the county seat, but no further. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, all Colorado District Courts were held in Denver, Colorado, in the State courthouse there, due to a lack of funds to build courthouses locally. All murder trials were held in Denver, in the District Courts. Allegedly, so many politically-motivated murders occurred between the predominately liberal, then, eastern Routt County, Colorado residents and the predominately conservative, then, western Routt County residents, that the presiding judges—tired of presiding over these murder trials—requested that the State legislature split Routt County into what is now Routt and Moffat County; the legislature complied.  </p>
