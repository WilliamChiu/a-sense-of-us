<p>Moffat County was created out of the western portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routt_County,_Colorado">Routt County</a> on February 27, 1911.  The county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moffat">David H. Moffat</a>, a Colorado tycoon who died in 1911. His railroad, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver,_Northwestern_&_Pacific_Railway">Denver, Northwestern & Pacific</a>, attempted to build a route from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver">Denver</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City">Salt Lake City</a>. In 1913, a reorganized railroad, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_and_Salt_Lake_Railway">Denver & Salt Lake</a>, reached as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig,_Colorado">Craig</a>, the county seat, but no further. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, all Colorado District Courts were held in Denver, Colorado, in the State courthouse there, due to a lack of funds to build courthouses locally. All murder trials were held in Denver, in the District Courts. Allegedly, so many politically-motivated murders occurred between the predominately liberal, then, eastern Routt County, Colorado residents and the predominately conservative, then, western Routt County residents, that the presiding judges--tired of presiding over these murder trials--requested that the State legislature split Routt County into what is now Routt and Moffat County; the legislature complied.  </p>
