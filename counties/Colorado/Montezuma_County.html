<p>Montezuma County has been settled since approximately AD 600, and had an estimated population of approximately 100,000, four times its current population, in the 12th century.  However, a series of events caused virtually all permanent settlements to be abandoned between 1200 and 1300, and the area was contested between nomadic Ute and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_people">Navajo</a> bands until resettlement occurred in the 1870s.  Montezuma County was created out of the western portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Plata_County,_Colorado">La Plata County</a> by the Colorado Legislature in April 1889.  It was named in honor of a famous chief of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec">Aztec</a> Indians in Mexico, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moctezuma_II">Moctezuma II</a>.  The building ruins in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_Verde_National_Park">Mesa Verde National Park</a> were thought to be of Aztec origin at the time.  </p>
