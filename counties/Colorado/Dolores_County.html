<p>It is thought that the area has been the site of human habitation since at least 2500 B.C. Dolores County's western portions were densely populated between 900 and 1300 AD. Population estimates of as many as 10,000 population, with villages of hundreds of rooms, have been made by archaeologists and other researchers.  But this population was destroyed or migrated elsewhere, apparently following a drought and severe societal upheaval in the 14th century, and for centuries thereafter, both the western and eastern mountainous areas of the county were occupied mostly by nomads, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_Indians">Ute</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_people">Navajo Indians</a>. Like much of southwestern Colorado, Dolores County is rich in Indian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruins">ruins</a> and sites of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anasazi">Anasazi</a>. According to the Anasazi Heritage Center, Dolores County contains at least 816 recorded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archaeological_sites">archaeological sites</a> as of 1989, with many more inventoried since that time.  </p>
