<p>When Grand County was created February 2, 1874 it was carved out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_County,_Colorado">Summit County</a> and contained land to the western and northern borders of the state, which is now in present day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffat_County,_Colorado">Moffat County</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routt_County,_Colorado">Routt County</a>. It was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Lake_(Colorado)">Grand Lake</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_River_(Colorado)">Grand River</a>, an old name for the upper Colorado River, which has its headwaters in the county. On January 29, 1877 Routt County was created and Grand County shrunk down to its current western boundary.  When valuable minerals were found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Park_(Colorado_basin)">North Park</a>, Grand County claimed the area as part of its county, a claim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larimer_County,_Colorado">Larimer County</a> also held. It took a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court in 1886 to declare North Park part of Larimer County, setting Grand County's northern boundary.  </p>
