<p>According to Goodspeed's History of Lincoln County, Missouri (1888), Lincoln County was named by Major Christopher Clark, the first permanent white settler, when he addressed the Territorial Legislature saying, "I was born, sir, in Link-Horn County, N.C., I lived for many years in Link-Horn County in old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kentucky">Kain-tuck</a>. I wish to die in Link-Horn County, in Missouri; and I move, therefore, that the blank in the bill be filled with the name Link-Horn." The motion was carried unanimously and the clerk, not adopting the frontier parlance of the Major, wrote "Lincoln" in the blank space of the bill. Others say it was named for Major General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a> who served in the Continental Army during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">American Revolutionary War</a>.  </p>
