<p>Scotland County was organized by act of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_General_Assembly">Missouri General Assembly</a> on January 29, 1841. At first its boundaries contained all the land now known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Missouri">Knox County</a> as well, but another act by the General Assembly in 1843 divided it off. Stephen W. B. Carnegy suggested that the county be named after his native country of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</a>. He also gave several settlements in the area Scottish names.  </p>
