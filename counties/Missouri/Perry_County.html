<p>Shaped like a camel's hump, Perry County consists of 471 sqmi that fit neatly into a wedge created by the confluence of Apple Creek and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River">Mississippi River</a>. Topographically, it is divided into lowlands and uplands. The lowlands comprise about one-eighth of the county and lie for the most part along the river. In the northeastern corner is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bois_Brule_Bottom">Bois Brule Bottom</a>, meaning Burnt Wood, the most extensive tract of lowland, approximately 15 mi long and up to 5 mi wide. Its rich soil, coupled with its size, makes it the most productive farmland in the county. Smaller in size but still important is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazeau_Bottom">Brazeau Bottom</a> on the Mississippi River below <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capes_on_the_Mississippi_River">Cape Cinque Hommes</a> and the bottom situated near the mouth of Apple Creek.  </p>
