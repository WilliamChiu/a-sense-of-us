<p>Cape Girardeau County was organized on October 1, 1812, as one of five original counties in the Missouri Territory after the US made the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> of 1803. It is named after Ensign Sieur Jean Baptiste de Girardot (also spelled Girardeau or Girardat), a French officer stationed 1704â€“1720 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaskaskia,_Illinois">Kaskaskia</a> in what the French called the Illinois Country. In 1733 he founded a trading post on the Mississippi River, which developed as the present-day city of Cape Girardeau. The "cape" in the county name was a rock promontory overlooking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River">Mississippi River</a> and Claire's house; the original cape rock was destroyed by railroad construction.   </p>
