<p>Before European contact, the area that today makes up Jasper County was the domain of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_Nation">Osage Native Americans</a> who called themselves the Children of the Middle Waters (Ni-U-Kon-Ska). This was probably because their dominion encompassed the land between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River">Missouri</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_River">Osage</a> rivers to the north, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River">Mississippi River</a> to the east, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_River">Arkansas River</a> to the south. To the west were the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains">Great Plains</a> where they hunted buffalo. By the late 17th century, the Osage were calling themselves ''Wah-Zha-Zhe.''  </p>
