<p>Wayne County was created in December 1818 by the last Missouri Territorial Legislature out of parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Girardeau_County,_Missouri">Cape Girardeau</a> and Lawrence counties and thus predates the state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri">Missouri</a> being admitted to the Union. In March 1819, Congress established the Territory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas">Arkansas</a> and most of Lawrence County, Missouri Territory became Lawrence County, Arkansas Territory. The small strip of “Old Lawrence County” that had been orphaned in Missouri was added to Wayne County by the Missouri State Constitution of 1820. The Osage Strip along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas">Kansas</a> border was added in 1825. From 1825-1831, Wayne County was an enormous area larger than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island">Rhode Island</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware">Delaware</a> combined.
