Howard was one of several counties settled mostly by Southerners along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River">Missouri River</a> in the central part of the state. Given their culture and traditions, this area became known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Dixie_(Missouri)">Little Dixie</a> and Howard County was at its heart.
