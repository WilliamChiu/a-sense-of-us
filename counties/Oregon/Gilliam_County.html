<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Legislative_Assembly">Oregon Legislative Assembly</a> created Gilliam County on February 25, 1885, from the eastern third of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasco_County,_Oregon">Wasco County</a> after residents complained that they were too far from their county seat in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalles,_Oregon">The Dalles</a>. The first Gilliam county seat was at Alkali, now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Oregon">Arlington</a>. The question of a permanent county seat was placed on general election ballots in 1886, 1888, and again in 1890, when voters chose to move the county seat to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condon,_Oregon">Condon</a>, known to early settlers as "Summit Springs." Once the question of the location of the county seat was settled, voters in Gilliam County proved reluctant to provide a courthouse in Condon. The county government operated out of a two-room house until 1903, when the county court appropriated money to construct a courthouse.  This courthouse burned down in 1954 and was replaced the following year with the current courthouse.  </p>
