<p>Grant County was established on October 14, 1864, from parts of old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasco_County,_Oregon">Wasco</a> and old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umatilla_County,_Oregon">Umatilla</a> counties. Prior to its creation, cases brought to court were tried in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalles,_Oregon">The Dalles</a>, county seat of the vast Wasco County. The great distance to The Dalles made law enforcement a difficult problem, and imposed a heavy burden on citizens who had a need to transact business at the courthouse. In 1889, more than half of the southern part of the original Grant County was taken to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harney_County,_Oregon">Harney County</a>. Also in 1899, a small part of northwestern Grant County was taken (along with parts of Crook and Gilliam counties) to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_County,_Oregon">Wheeler County</a>.  </p>
