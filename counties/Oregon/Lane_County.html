It was named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Territory">territory</a>'s first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Oregon#U.S._Territorial_Governors_(1848-1859)">governor</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lane">Joseph Lane</a>. Originally it covered all of southern Oregon east to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and south to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a> border. When the Territorial Legislature created Lane County, it did not designate a county seat. In the 1853 election four sites competed for the designation, of which the "Mulligan donation" received a majority vote; however, since it was contiguous to the "Skinner claim" both became part of the new county seat known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon">Eugene</a>.  </p>
