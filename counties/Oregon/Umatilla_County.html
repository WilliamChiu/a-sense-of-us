Adjustments were made to the county's boundaries following the creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_County,_Oregon">Grant</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrow_County,_Oregon">Morrow</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_Oregon">Union</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallowa_County,_Oregon">Wallowa</a> Counties. This legislative act also designated Marshall Station as the temporary county seat.

With the development of wheat farming, population shifted to the north and east parts of the county, and a subsequent election in 1868 moved the county seat again to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendleton,_Oregon">Pendleton</a>.  </p>
