<p>The area originally was inhabited by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpqua_(tribe)">Umpqua</a> Indians, who speak a language in the Athabaskan  language family (although some linguists put it in the Penutian family). Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_River_Indian_War">Rogue River Indian War</a> in 1856, most of the remaining natives were moved by the government to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ronde_Indian_Reservation">Grand Ronde Indian Reservation</a>. However, seven families of Umpqua hid in the hills, eluding capture for many decades.  They are now Federally recognized as the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians. The tribe manages a small reservation in Canyonville, Oregon, and has a Casino/Hotel named Seven Feathers to represent the seven families who refused forced removal to the Grand Ronde Reservation.   </p>
