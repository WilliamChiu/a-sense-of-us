<p>Multnomah County (the thirteenth in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Territory">Oregon Territory</a>) was created on December 22, 1854, formed out of the eastern part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_County,_Oregon">Washington</a> and the northern part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clackamas_County,_Oregon">Clackamas</a> counties. Its creation was a result of a petition earlier that year by businessmen in Portland complaining of the inconvenient location of the Washington County seat in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsboro,_Oregon">Hillsboro</a> and of the share of Portland tax revenues leaving the city to support Washington County farmers. County commissioners met for the first time on January 17, 1855. The county is named after the Chinook word for the "lower river", Multnomah and Matlnomaq being alternative, interpretive English spellings of the same word. In Chinook Jargon,  Ne-matlnomaq, means the "place of matlnomaq" or the (singular)Ne-matlnomag, "the lower river", from the Oregon City Falls to the Columbia river.  The explorer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clark_(explorer)">William Clark</a> wrote in his Journal: "I entered this river...called Multnomah...from a nation who reside on Wappato Island, a little below the enterence" (quoted from ''Willamette Landings'' by H.M. Corning).  </p>
