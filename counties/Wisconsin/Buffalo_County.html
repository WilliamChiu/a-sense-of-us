<p>Buffalo County, founded in 1853, is named for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_River_(Wisconsin)">Buffalo River</a>, which flows from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strum,_Wisconsin">Strum</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma,_Wisconsin">Alma, Wisconsin</a>, where it empties into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River">Mississippi River</a>. The Buffalo River obtained its name from the French voyager Father <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Hennepin">Louis Hennepin</a>, who named it “Riviere des Boeufs” in 1680.  The first permanent settlement was established in 1839, located in what is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_City,_Wisconsin">Fountain City</a>.  This settlement was originally named Holmes' Landing after a family that traded with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux">Sioux</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_people">Chippewa</a>.  Buffalo County was settled primarily by Swiss, German, and Norwegian immigrants who were drawn to the area by the growing lumber industry, fertile soils, access to the Mississippi, and available land.  By 1848 a second community was established called Twelve Mile Bluff, which is now known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma,_Wisconsin">Alma</a>.  </p>
