<p>The earliest recorded event in Taylor county probably occurred in 1661, when Wisconsin was part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France">New France</a>. A band of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people">Huron Indians</a> from eastern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario">Ontario</a> had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Wars">fled</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Iroquois</a> and taken refuge near the headwaters of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_River_(Mississippi_River)">Black River</a>, probably around Lake Chelsea in the northeast part of the county.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Menard">Father René Menard</a>, a French <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus">Jesuit priest</a> who had travelled up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes">Great Lakes</a> as far as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keweenaw_Bay">Keweenaw Bay</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upper_Michigan">upper Michigan</a>, heard that these Hurons were starving. He decided to try to reach them to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baptism">baptize</a> them, despite his own weak health and scant supplies. In mid-summer he and a French <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_Trade">fur trader</a> set out, following rivers and streams in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birch_bark">birchbark</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canoe">canoe</a>s down into Wisconsin. Finally, a day's journey from the Huron camp, Father Menard separated from his travelling companion at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapid">rapid</a>s to carry some supplies.
