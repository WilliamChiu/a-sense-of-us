It was named after Andrew Holmes, an officer in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812">War of 1812</a>. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a>, small-scale riots broke out in ethnic German areas. Holmes County was an isolated localistic area dominated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> and some recent German immigrants. It was a Democratic stronghold and few men dared speak out in favor of conscription.

In June 1863, small scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.  </p>
