<p>Holmes County was formed on January 20, 1824 from portions of Coshocton, Tuscarawas and Wayne Counties.  It was named after Andrew Holmes, an officer in the War of 1812.  During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a>, small-scale riots broke out in ethnic German areas. Holmes County was an isolated localistic area dominated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> and some recent German immigrants.

Local politicians denounced Lincoln and Congress as despotic, seeing the draft law as a violation of their local autonomy. In June 1863, small scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.  </p>
