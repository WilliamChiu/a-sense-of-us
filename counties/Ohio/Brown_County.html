<p>Brown County was said to be the place of origin of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burley_tobacco">White Burley</a> type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobacco">tobacco</a>, grown in 1864 by George Webb and Joseph Fore on the farm of Captain Frederick Kautz near Higginsport from seed from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracken_County,_Kentucky">Bracken County, Kentucky</a>. He noticed it yielded a different type of light leaf shaded from white to yellow, and cured differently.  By 1866, he harvested 20,000 pounds of Burley tobacco and sold it in 1867 at the St. Louis Fair for $58 per hundred pounds. By 1883, the principal market for this tobacco was Cincinnati, but it was grown throughout central Kentucky and Middle Tennessee.  Later the type became referred to as burley tobacco, and it was air-cured.  </p>
