<p>From 2000 to 2010, the number of people living in households has changed by -5.467314%. This change is a drastic departure from that of the nation. Data from this state suggests that the region suffered stagnated household-population growth perhaps as a result of regional economic issues.</p>

<p>The county was barely inhabited until the 1830s, but by 1860 its population had massively increased to about half the current number of inhabitants. It grew slowly thereafter, with periods of more marked increase towards the end of the 19th century, during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Great Depression</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post–World_War_II_baby_boom">post–World War II baby boom</a>. In 1980 it was censused at 61,901, and has been declining since. Since about 2000, the county's population declines by about 100–300 persons annually, mainly due to a migration deficit of about 300 persons annually. This decline is projected to continue in the future.  </p>
