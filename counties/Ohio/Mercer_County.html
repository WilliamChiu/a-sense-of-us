<p>Mercer County was founded in 1820 which set it apart from Darke County.  Land south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Greenville">Greenville Treaty Line</a> was still part of Darke County.  An act establishing Mercer County took place on January 2, 1824.  In 1837 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Wert_County,_Ohio">Van Wert County</a> was detached and the county line established is the current northern border of Mercer County.  In 1839 Celina was established as the capital of Mercer County, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Marys,_Ohio">St. Marys, Ohio</a> was the previous capital.  In 1848 the area south of the Greenville Treaty Line to the current southern county line, was attached.  When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auglaize_County,_Ohio">Auglaize County, Ohio</a> was formed, Mercer County's eastern border was moved 6 miles west with the exception of the area south of the Greenville Treaty line.  This created the sharp point at Mercer County's south-east corner and was the last county line modification.  </p>
