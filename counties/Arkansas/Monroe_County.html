<p>Settlement in Monroe County began when Dedrick Pike settled where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_River_(Arkansas)">Cache River</a> enters the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_River_(Arkansas)">White River</a> in 1816. The settlement was named Mouth of the Cache, and a post office by that name was opened years later. The community renamed itself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarendon,_Arkansas">Clarendon</a> in 1824 in honor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Clarendon">Earl of Clarendon</a>. Monroe County was established under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Territory">Arkansas territorial</a> legislature in 1829, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/county_seat">county seat</a> was established at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurenceville,_Arkansas">Lawrenceville</a> where a jail and courthouse were erected. A ferry across the White River came in 1836, and the county seat was moved to Clarendon in 1857, with the new brick courthouse nearly finished at the outbreak of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a>. The county sent five units into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America">Confederate</a> service, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)">Union</a> captured Clarendon in 1863 and destroyed the city. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law">Martial law</a> was established for four years after the war as guerilla warfare continued and the county struggled to rebuild.

The Monroe County Sun was established in 1876.  </p>
