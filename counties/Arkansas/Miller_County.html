<p>Miller County was originally created in 1820 and included most of the current Miller County as well as most of what are now counties in Texas: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowie_County,_Texas">Bowie</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_County,_Texas">Red River</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_County,_Texas">Lamar</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannin_County,_Texas">Fannin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_County,_Texas">Cass</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_County,_Texas">Morris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_County,_Texas">Titus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Texas">Franklin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins_County,_Texas">Hopkins</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_County,_Texas">Delta</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_County,_Texas">Hunt</a>.  In 1831 the county seat was located what is the current day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarksville,_Texas">Clarksville</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas">Texas</a>.  When Arkansas achieved statehood the same year Texas declared itself an independent republic in 1836 a dispute over the common border arose, with the area in Miller County having representation in both the Arkansas legislature and the Texas congress.  In 1837 and 1838, Texas organized Red River and Fannin counties, respectively, in the area.  Arkansas attempted to counter by making it a misdemeanor for Miller County residents to hold office in Texas, and then by establishing a county court in Fannin.  The attempts were ultimately unsuccessful, and in 1845 Texas was annexed by the United States, settling the boundary between Texas and Arkansas.  As much of Miller County was lost to Texas, the county was dissolved with the remaining territory returning to Lafayette County.  </p>
