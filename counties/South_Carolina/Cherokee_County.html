<p>When European traders and settlers entered the area, they used the existing Native American paths: called collectively the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_Path">Trading Path</a>. The Upper Road and Lower Cherokee Traders Path were paths that passed through the piedmont.  The former connected to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>, leading from the Virginia Tidewater into the Piedmont and to the South. The Lower Cherokee Traders Path especially connected areas in present-day western North Carolina, northern South Carolina and northeastern Georgia. In the mid-18th century, waves of British migrants and immigrants, an estimated 250,000 people, traveled by these paths into Cherokee and neighboring counties in the piedmont. This backcountry area was initially settled especially by immigrant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people">Ulster Scots people</a>, Germans and Anglo-Americans migrating into the area.   </p>
