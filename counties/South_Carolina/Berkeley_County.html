<p>Berkeley County was established in 1682.  It was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berkeley,_1st_Baron_Berkeley_of_Stratton">John</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Berkeley_(governor)">William Berkeley</a>, co-owners of the Province of Carolina.  It became part of the Charleston District in 1769.  It did not exist as a District during most of the 19th century and generally was part of the Low Country culture.  In 1882, following white Democrats regaining control of the state legislature after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era_(United_States)">Reconstruction era</a>, they established this as a county in 1882, with its seat at Mount Pleasant.  The county seat was moved in 1895 to Moncks Corner.  </p>
