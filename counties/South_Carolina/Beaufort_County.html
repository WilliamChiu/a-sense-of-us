<p>From the early days of plantations, African slaves outnumbered the European minority in the colony. The plantations on the Sea Islands had especially large concentrations of slaves, and frequently limited interaction with whites. The islands were sites of the development of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_people">Gullah</a> culture, which preserved elements from a variety of West African roots; the people also developed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah_language">Gullah language</a>, a creole language. The county was majority black nearly to the mid-20th century.   </p>
