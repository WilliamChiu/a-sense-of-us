<p>Horry County was incorporated in 1801.  At that time the county had an estimated population of 550.  It was completely surrounded by water, which forced the inhabitants to survive virtually without any assistance from the "outside world".  This caused the county residents to become an extremely independent populace, and they named their county "The Independent Republic of Horry". The county was named after, and in honor of, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">Revolutionary War</a> hero, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Horry">Peter Horry</a> who was born in South Carolina sometime around 1743.
