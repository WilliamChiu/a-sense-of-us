<p>The first Renville County was created by the 1872-73 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Territory">Dakota Territory</a> legislature, but was dissolved because of too little settlement. The name was then brought back in the 1908 general election under a proposal to divide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_County,_North_Dakota">Ward County</a>. Though defeated on election day, the matter went to court, which led to the creation of the present-day Renville County in 1910.
