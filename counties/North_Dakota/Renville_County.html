<p>The first Renville County was created by the 1872-73 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Territory">Dakota Territory</a> legislature, but was dissolved because of too little settlement. The name was then brought back in the 1908 general election under a proposal to divide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_County,_North_Dakota">Ward County</a>. Though defeated on election day, the matter went to court, which led to the creation of the present-day Renville County in 1910. The county government was first organized on July 23, 1910; Mohall has always been the county seat. The county's name honors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Renville">Joseph Renville</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interpreter">interpreter</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/translator">translator</a>, and important figure in dealings between white men and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux">Sioux</a>.  </p>
