<p>For thousands of years, various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_peoples">indigenous peoples</a> inhabited the area along the Pembina and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_of_the_North">Red rivers</a>.  At the time of European contact in the 16th century, the dominant tribes were the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assiniboine_people">Assiniboine</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people">Lakota</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux">Sioux</a>, as the French colonists called them). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a>, also known as Chippewa, a branch of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe">Anishinaabe</a>-speaking language group, gradually migrated west along both sides of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes">Great Lakes</a>.  They developed a long trading relationship with French trappers and colonists.  Throughout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_of_the_North">Red River of the North</a> area, French trappers married Native American women, and their descendants continued to hunt and trap. A large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mixed-race">mixed-race</a> population developed, recognized as an ethnic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations">First Nations</a> group in Canada called the ''<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Métis">Métis</a>''.  The Chippewa and Métis generally supported the French forces during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years'_War">Seven Years' War</a> in the mid-eighteenth century against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain">Great Britain</a>.  </p>
