<p>Golden Valley was originally part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billings_County,_North_Dakota">Billings County</a>. Voters elected to separate from Billings County in 1910, but litigation prevented formal organization of the county until 1912. The territory in the surrounding area was colloquially referred to as, Rattlesnake Flats, due to the large number of the snakes found in the area. The region was dubbed Golden Valley in 1902 after a group of land surveyors noticed that the sunlight gave the surrounding grasses a distinct golden color.  </p>
