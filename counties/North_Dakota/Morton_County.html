It was organized on March 23, 1878, but the action of the 1878 legislature in attaching the eastern portion to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burleigh_County,_North_Dakota">Burleigh County</a> effectively nullified this action. The county was reorganized on February 18, 1881, after the detached portion had been returned to Morton County by the 1881 legislature. Mandan has always been the county seat, though during a period from 1878 to 1879, Mandan, and thus also the county seat, was known as Lincoln.  </p>
