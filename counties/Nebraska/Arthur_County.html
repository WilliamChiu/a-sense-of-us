<p>Arthur County was formed in 1913. It was named after President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>. Arthur County was formed from what had been McPherson County after there had been an effort to move the McPherson County seat from Tryon to the more centrally located Flats.  Rather than lose the county seat the residents of Tryon agreed to have the county divided approximately in half when it was discovered that such a division had been part of earlier governmental planning.  The county seat for Arthur County became the newly formed Arthur, which was formed and incorporated for that purpose.  The village of Arthur is located in a valley location near the geographic center of the county.  </p>
