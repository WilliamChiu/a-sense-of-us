<p>Red Willow County was formed in 1873. It was named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Willow_Creek">Red Willow Creek</a>.  The name is reported to be a mistranslation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_language">Dakota</a> Indian name ''Chanshasha Wakpala,'' which literally means Red Dogwood Creek. The Dakota referred to the creek as such because of an abundance of the red dogwood shrub that grew along the creek banks.  Its stem and branches are deep red in color, and it is favored in basket making.   </p>
