<p>When Nebraska became a state in 1867, a single county encompassed the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Panhandle">Panhandle</a>.  In 1870, the southern half of the Panhandle was organized as Cheyenne County.  The arrival of increasing numbers of settlers led to the partitioning of the county in 1888: the eastern third became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuel_County,_Nebraska">Deuel County</a>; the middle third became present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_County,_Nebraska">Cheyenne County</a>; and the western third became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimball_County,_Nebraska">Kimball</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotts_Bluff_County,_Nebraska">Scotts Bluff</a>, and Banner Counties.  </p>
