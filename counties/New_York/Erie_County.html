<p>When counties were established in New York State in 1683 present-day Erie County was Indian territory and was not part of New York.  Significant European settlement began ca. 1800 after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Land_Company">Holland Land Company</a> extinguished Indian claims to the land, acquired the title to eight western-most counties of Western New York, surveyed their holdings, established towns, and began selling lots.  At this time, all of Western New York was part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_County,_New_York">Ontario County</a>.  In 1802, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesee_County,_New_York">Genesee County</a> was created out of Ontario County.  In 1808, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_County,_New_York">Niagara County</a> was created out of Genesee County.  In 1821, Erie County was created out of Niagara County, encompassing all of the land between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonawanda_Creek">Tonawanda Creek</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattaraugus_Creek">Cattaraugus Creek</a>.  </p>
