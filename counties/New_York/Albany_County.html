<p>After England took control of New Netherlands from the Dutch, Albany County was created on November 1, 1683 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Governor">New York Governor</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dongan,_2nd_Earl_of_Limerick">Thomas Dongan</a>, and later confirmed on October 1, 1691. The act creating the county vaguely defined its territory "to containe the Towns of Albany, the Collony Rensselaerwyck, Schonecteda, and all the villages, neighborhoods, and Christian Planta√ßons on the east side of Hudson River from Roelef's Creek, and on the west side from Sawyer's Creek (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saugerties_(village),_New_York">Saugerties</a>) to the Sarraghtoga." The confirmation declared in 1691 was similar but omitted the Town of Albany, substituted "Mannor of Ranselaerswyck" for "Collony Rensselaerwyck", and stated "to the uttermost end of Sarraghtoga" instead of just "to Sarraghtoga". Livingston Manor was annexed to Albany County from Dutchess County in 1717.   </p>
