They had their council-fire at what is now present-day Fishkill Hook, and also held gatherings along the Danskammer. On November 1, 1683, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_New_York">Province of New York</a> established its first twelve counties, with Dutchess County being one of them.
