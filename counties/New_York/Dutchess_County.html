<p>Prior to Anglo-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Dutch</a> settlement, what is today Dutchess County was a leading center for the native <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wappinger">Wappinger</a> peoples. They had their council-fire at what is now present-day Fishkill Hook, and also held gatherings along the Danskammer. On November 1, 1683, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_New_York">Province of New York</a> established its first twelve counties, with Dutchess County being one of them. Its boundaries at that time included the present <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putnam_County,_New_York">Putnam County</a>, and a small portion of the present <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_County,_New_York">Columbia County</a> (the towns of Clermont and Germantown). The county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Modena">Mary of Modena</a>, Duchess of York, second wife of James, Duke of York (later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II,_King_of_England">James II, King of England</a>). "Dutchess" is an archaic form of duchess.  </p>
