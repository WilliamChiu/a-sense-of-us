<p>Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the land Wayne County encompasses was originally part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Iroquois</a> Confederacy, which had existed from around August 31, 1142. When counties were established in New York State on November 1, 1683, it became part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_County,_New_York">Albany County</a>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State and all of the present State of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont">Vermont</a>, extending (in theory) westward to the Pacific Ocean. In 1804, after numerous acts of subdividing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_County,_New_York">Seneca County</a> was formed by the splitting of Cayuga County, which, in turn, was reduced in size by combining portions of Seneca and the remainder of Cayuga County to form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_County,_New_York">Tompkins County</a> in 1817.  </p>
