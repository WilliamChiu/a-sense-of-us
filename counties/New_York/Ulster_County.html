<p>The area of present day Ulster County was called Esopus by the Dutch settlers: it was then part of the New Netherland Colony. In 1652 Thomas Chambers, a freeholder from Rensselaerwyck, purchased land at Esopus and began trading there. In 1654 Johan de Hulter, owner of 20% of the Killian van Rensselaer Company was granted a patent,together with the patents of Christoffel Davids, and Jacob Jansen Stoll, this supplies evidence of the first permanent settlement, that grows into the village of Wiltwijck, later: Kingston. In 1683, the Duke of York created twelve counties in his province. Ulster County was one of them. Its boundaries at that time included the present <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_County,_New_York">Sullivan County</a>, and portions of the present <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_County,_New_York">Delaware</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_New_York">Orange</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_New_York">Greene Counties</a>.  </p>
