<p>In 1609, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudson">Henry Hudson</a>, thinking he had found the legendary "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Passage">Northwest Passage</a>", sailed on the ''Half Moon'' up the river that would one day bear his name and anchored near the area that is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverstraw,_New_York">Haverstraw</a> before continuing to disillusionment north of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York">Albany</a>.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people">Dutch</a> were the first Europeans to settle in the area, around 1675.  These settlers, eager to escape "city life", moved from Manhattan to Rockland.  A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin.  When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York">Duke of York</a> (who became King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England">James II of England</a>) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_New_York">Orange County</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangetown,_New_York">Orangetown</a> was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyack,_New_York">Nyack</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tappan,_New_York">Tappan</a>, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.  </p>
