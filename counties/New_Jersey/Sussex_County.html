<p>The area of Sussex County and its surrounding region was occupied for approximately 8,000-10,000 years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsee_people">Munsee Indians</a> inhabited the region.  The Munsee were a loosely organized division of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape">Lenape</a> (or Lenni Lenape), a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</a> people also called "Delaware Indians" after their historic territory along the Delaware River. The Lenape inhabited the mid-Atlantic coastal areas and inland along the Hudson and Delaware rivers.  The Munsee spoke a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsee_language">very distinct dialect</a> of the Lenape and inhabited a region bounded by the Hudson River, the head waters of the Delaware River and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susquehanna_River">Susquehanna River</a>, and south to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehigh_River">Lehigh River</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conewago_Creek_(west)">Conewago Creek</a>.  As a result of disruption following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War">French and Indian War</a> (1756–1763) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">American Revolutionary War</a> (1775–1783) and later Indian removals from the eastern United States, the main Lenape groups now live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario">Ontario</a>  in Canada, and in Wisconsin and Oklahoma in the United States.  </p>
