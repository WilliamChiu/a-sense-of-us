<p>After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Glacier">Wisconsin Glacier</a> melted around 13,000 B.C., the area slowly warmed. At first the area was Tundra, and later changed to Taiga/Boreal Forests. Water was everywhere in the northern part of the county due to the glacier melt.  The water drained slowly and grasses grew.
