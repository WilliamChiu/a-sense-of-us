<p>After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Glacier">Wisconsin Glacier</a> melted around 13,000 B.C., the area slowly warmed. At first the area was Tundra, and later changed to Taiga/Boreal Forests. Water was everywhere in the northern part of the county due to the glacier melt.  The water drained slowly and grasses grew. There was a big lake at Great Meadows. The area was still cold, so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coniferous">coniferous</a> forests and grasslands grew.  Big game such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mastodons">mastodons</a> came into the area.  This is when Paleo Indians moved into the area. Paleo Indians lived in small groups and traveled in search of game and plants to eat.  They were hunter-gathers.  They made spear points of jasper and black chert.  They lived near water and moved after game became scarce in the area.  Their camp sites are many feet below the present ground surface,. This is why they are difficult to locate.  </p>
