<p>Jones County along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_County,_Georgia"> Morgan County</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putnam_County,_Georgia"> Putnam County</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_County,_Georgia"> Old Randolph</a> were established by an act of the Georgia General Assembly passed on December 10, 1807 from land that had originally been part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_County,_Georgia">Baldwin County</a> in 1803 and before that part of the Creek Nation. Jones County was originally bounded by a line running North 56° East to Commissioners Creek, then North 15° West to Cedar Creek, then up the creek to corner Randolph County and Putnam County, then along a line to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocmulgee_River">Ocmulgee River</a>, and then down the river to where the old county line between Wilkinson County and Baldwin County was. This excluded parts of what is now Bibb County east of the Ocmulgee River, including the location of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Benjamin_Hawkins">Fort Benjamin Hawkins</a> as they were part of a reserve guaranteed to the Creek Nation. Those areas were later added to Jones County after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Indian_Springs">Treaty of Indian Springs</a>.  </p>
