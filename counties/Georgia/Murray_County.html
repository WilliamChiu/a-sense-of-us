<p>In December, 1832 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_General_Assembly">Georgia General Assembly</a> designated the extreme northwestern corner of the state as Murray County.  Formerly part of Cherokee County, the area was named for a distinguished Georgia statesman from Lincoln County, Mr. Thomas W. Murray, a former speaker of the Georgia House.  Within a short time the legislature found the county was too large to administer properly as the population grew, for the county then included what is now Dade, Walker, Catoosa, Whitfield, Murray, Gordon and parts of Bartow and Chatooga Counties, so further division became necessary.    Within two decades, Murray County came to be 342 sqmi of land with Spring Place as its county seat until the railroad was built through Chatsworth. With Chatsworth more accessible, the county seat was moved there.  </p>
