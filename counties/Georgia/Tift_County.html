<p>The county was created on August 17, 1905, and is named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Harding_Tift">Henry Harding Tift</a>, who founded Tifton. In 1872, Tift purchased about 65,000 acres of virgin pine timberland there in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiregrass">wiregrass</a> section of South Georgia and established a sawmill and a village for his workers.  Tift eventually expanded into turpentine and barrel-making operations, and turned his barren timberlands into farms for cotton, corn, livestock, fruit, tobacco, pecans and sweet potatoes.  When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Southern_and_Florida_Railway">Georgia Southern and Florida Railway</a> intersected the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_and_Western_Railroad">Brunswick and Western Railroad</a> near Tift's mill in 1888, the settlement was connected to Atlanta and became a boom town.  It was incorporated as Tifton by the Georgia Legislature in 1890.    </p>
