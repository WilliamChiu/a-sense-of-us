<p>As early as 1760, explorers came to the area now known as Rabun County. In the 18th century, the population of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_Indians">Cherokee</a> in the area was so heavy that this portion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> was sometimes called the "Cherokee Mountains."  The early explorers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/settlers">settlers</a> divided the Cherokee people into three divisions depending on location and dialect, the Lower, Middle, and Over-the-Hill. There were at least four Cherokee settlements in what would later become Rabun County. A Middle settlement called Stikayi (''Stiyaki, Sticoa, Stekoa'') was located on Stekoa Creek, probably southeast of the present-day Clayton. An Over-the-Hill settlement called Tallulah was located on the upper portion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallulah_River">Tallulah River</a>. There were also two Cherokee settlements of unknown division, Chicherohe (Chechero), which was destroyed during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">American Revolutionary War</a>, located along Warwoman Creek, east of Clayton, and Eastertoy (''Eastatowth, Estatowee'') which was located near the present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillard,_Georgia">Dillard</a>.  </p>
