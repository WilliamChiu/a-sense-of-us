It was named by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_General_Assembly">Georgia General Assembly</a> in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butts">Samuel Butts</a>, an officer who was killed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War">Creek War</a> in 1814. A year later, Jackson was created as the first city in the new county and became the county seat. Other towns followed, including Indian Springs (1837); Flovilla (1883); Jenkinsburg (1889); and Pepperton (1897). Indian Springs later became unincorporated and Pepperton was merged with Jackson in 1966, leaving 3 incorporated cities in Butts County. In recent years, Indian Springs has again become a tourist destination including many historic sites, shops, eating establishment and the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Springs_Hotel">Indian Springs Hotel</a> as its centerpiece.   </p>
