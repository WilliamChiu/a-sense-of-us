<p>Henry County, Georgia was created by the Georgia State Legislature in 1821 from land acquired from the Creek Indian Nation by the First Treaty of Indian Springs. Henry's original land area was much larger than it is today, stretching from near Indian Springs (present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Springs_State_Park">Indian Springs State Park</a>) in the south to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattahoochee_River">Chattahoochee River</a> near Sandy Springs in the north; encompassing most of present day Metropolitan Atlanta. Before one year passed the size of the County was diminished through the separation of land areas which, in whole or in part, became present day DeKalb, Fulton, Fayette and Newton Counties.  Later divisions resulted in Clayton, Spalding, Rockdale and Butts Counties.  </p>
