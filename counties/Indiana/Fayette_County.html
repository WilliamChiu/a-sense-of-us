It was named for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_La_Fayette">Marquis de la Fayette</a>, a French hero of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_War">Revolutionary War</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connersville">Connersville</a>, then a small village of less than a hundred inhabitants, was designated the county seat.  The county was divided into 5 townships (Harrison, Connersville, Jennings, Columbia and Brownsville) in Feb. 1819, "Connersville" containing the namesake town. In 1821, the organization of Waterloo Township subsumed the portion of Brownsville Township remaining in Fayette County, along with a portion of Harrison Township west of the Whitewater River.  </p>
