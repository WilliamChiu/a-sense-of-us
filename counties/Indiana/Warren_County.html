<p>In the centuries before the arrival of European settlers, the area that became Warren County was on the boundary between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_people">Miami</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickapoo_people">Kickapoo</a> tribes.  By the late 18th&nbsp;century, many Miami had moved further south; most of Indiana north of the Wabash was then occupied by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> people.  The first non-indigenous settler in the area was probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachariah_Cicott">Zachariah Cicott</a>, a French-Canadian who first traded with the Kickapoo and Potawatomi people around 1802.
