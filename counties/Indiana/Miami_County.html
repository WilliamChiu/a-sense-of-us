<p>Indiana became a state on December 11, 1816, after being Indiana territory for sixteen years. Originally, Indiana was part of the Northwest Territory, which was made up of land gained by the British after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War">French and Indian War</a> and organized into a territory after the American Revolution. It was after the revolution that settlement in the area by Europeans really began. Knox territory was created in 1790 and included all of present day Indiana and areas of Illinois. Ancestryâ€™s Red Book notes that jurisdiction in Knox territory changed due to Indian uprisings in the area from 1790-1810. In 1800, Indiana became the name of a territory. Parts Michigan and Illinois both broke away from the territory before it became a state in 1816.  </p>
