<p>The original Newton County was formed by statute on February 7, 1835, and was a roughly square area some 30 miles on a side, encompassing what is now the northern half of the county, the northern half of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_County,_Indiana">Jasper County</a>, and a large section to the north.  The northern border was cut back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kankakee_River">Kankakee River</a> on February 1, 1836, with all land north of the Kankakee River going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Indiana">Lake</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_County,_Indiana">Porter</a> counties. The county was abolished and combined with Jasper County in 1839. On December 8, 1859, the county was re-created and the borders were redrawn to essentially their current state.  </p>
