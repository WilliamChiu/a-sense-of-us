<p>The United States acquired the land from the Indians, part of which forms the southwest section of what is now Brown County, in the 1809 treaty of Fort Wayne.  By the treaty of St. Mary's in 1818 considerably more territory became property of the government and this included Brown County Land.  No settler was allowed in the area until the government survey was completed in 1820.  The first white man known to arrive was a German, Johann Schoonover, who lived for a short time on the creek later named for him to trade with the Indians, about 1820.  In that same year William Elkins, the first pioneer, built a log cabin and cleared land in what became Johnson Township.  </p>
