<p>Approximately 12,000&nbsp;years ago, Native Americans began migrating into Florida. The tribes settling in modern day Palm Beach County included the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ais_people">Ais</a>', <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calusa">Calusa</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaega">Jaega</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayaimi">Mayaimi</a>s, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequesta">Tequesta</a>s. An estimated 20,000&nbsp;Native Americans lived in South Florida when the Spanish arrived. Their population diminished significantly by the 18th century, due to warfare, enslavement, and diseases from Europe. In 1513, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_León">Juan Ponce de León</a>, who led a European expedition to Florida earlier that year, became the first non-Native American to reach Palm Beach County, after landing in the modern day Jupiter area. Among the first non-Native American residents were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American">African American</a>s, many of whom were former slaves or immediate descendants of former slaves who had escaped to the State of Florida from slave plantations located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)">Georgia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</a>. Runaway African slaves started coming to what was then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida">Spanish Florida</a> in the late 17th century and they found refuge among the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole">Seminole</a> Native Americans. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole_Wars">Seminole Wars</a>, these African-American slaves fought with the Seminoles against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_American">White</a> settlers and bounty hunters. Portions of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Seminole_War">Second Seminole War</a> occurred in Palm Beach County, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jupiter_Inlet">Battle of Jupiter Inlet</a> in 1838.  </p>
