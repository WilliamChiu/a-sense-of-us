<p>The entire coast line of Franklin County was inhabited by Native Americans for about 12,000 years. Life along the coast was good since seafood was abundant. They traded with the Native Americans in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee">Tallahassee</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clay">clay</a> and other items not available on the coast. One style of pottery first found in Carrabelle is named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrabelle_Punctuated">Carrabelle Punctuated</a>. A clay pot was made and, while still damp, the potter would take a small stick of a similar object and press the end of the stick into the clay numerous times until the entire pot was covered with small indentations. It was then placed into a shallow pit, covered with small tree branches, and fired. The result was a decorated water resistant pot.  </p>
