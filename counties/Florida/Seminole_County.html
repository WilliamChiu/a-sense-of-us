<p>On July 21, 1821, there were two counties that formed Florida: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escambia_County,_Florida">Escambia</a> to the west and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Johns_County,_Florida">St. Johns</a> to the east. In 1824, the area to the south of St. Johns County was designated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_County">Mosquito County</a>, with its seat at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise,_Florida">Enterprise</a>. The county's name was changed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_Florida">Orange County</a> in 1845 when Florida became a state, and over the next 70 years several other counties were created. Seminole County was one of the last to split.  </p>
