<p>Collier County was created in 1923 from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_County,_Florida">Lee County</a>.  It was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron_Collier">Barron Collier</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a> advertising mogul and real estate developer who had moved into Southwest Florida and established himself as a prominent land owner.  He agreed to build the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamiami_Trail">Tamiami Trail</a> for what was then Lee County (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_County,_Florida">Lee</a>, Collier, Hendry, Glades & Charlotte Counties) in exchange for favorable consideration with the state legislature to have a county named for him. After the county was named, Collier was quoted as saying "When I first came here on holiday with Juliet, I never expected that I would buy a whole region of it, nor did I expect to pay for the new Tamiami Trail, or half the things I've done. But I really didn't expect to have a whole county named after me."  </p>
