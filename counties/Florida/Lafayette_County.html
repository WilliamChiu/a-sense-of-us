At the time it comprised all the area of present-day Lafayette and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_County,_Florida">Dixie</a> counties. The County was named in honor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a>, the French general who rendered assistance to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army">Continental Army</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">American Revolutionary War</a>. The famed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwannee_River">Suwannee River</a> forms the entire eastern boundary. The county courts first met at the home of Ariel Jones near Fayetteville. The county seat was New Troy until the court house burned down on New Year's Eve, 1892. It was moved to Mayo in 1893, and Mayo is currently Lafayette's only incorporated town. The moving of the courthouse was the end for New Troy.

In 1921 the lower part of the county was removed to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_County,_Florida">Dixie County</a>.  </p>
