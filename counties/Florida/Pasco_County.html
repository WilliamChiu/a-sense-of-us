<p>Pasco County was created on June 2, 1887, from the southern third of Hernando County.  The same legislation also created Citrus County from the northern third of Hernando County.  The county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Pasco">Samuel Pasco</a>, who had just been elected to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate">United States Senate</a>. Dade City was named the temporary county seat until a popular vote was held in 1889, at which time voters made Dade City the permanent county seat. As early as 1917, residents of the western part of the county proposed forming a separate county or merging with Pinellas County, as Dade City was not centrally located in the county. The issue was finally resolved in the late 1970s with the construction of identical government centers in both Dade City and New Port Richey.  </p>
