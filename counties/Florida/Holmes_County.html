<p>The county's namesake is a point of debate.  Holmes Creek - the county's eastern boundary - bore that name before the county was created, but it was originally named Weekaywehatchee (a Creek Indian name meaning "spring creek").  One claim is that the county was named for Thomas J. Holmes, who came from North Carolina to settle in the area about 1830.  Another is that it is named after Holmes, a half-breed American Indian chief who settled in the area with his band of Red Stick Creek Indians after 1814.  He was subsequently killed in 1818 by a raiding party sent by Andrew Jackson during the First Seminole War.  </p>
