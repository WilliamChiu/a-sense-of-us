<p>On June 14, 1849, Ute chiefs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkara">Walkara</a> and Sowiette went to the Salt Lake Valley to ask Mormon leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young">Brigham Young</a> to settle a group of his people in the valley of Sanpitch, about 125 mi to the south. Wanting to honor their request and needing to found new settlements where the quickly-growing population of Salt Lake could expand, Brigham Young sent a party to explore the area in August of that year. It was deemed favorable to settlement, and Brigham Young called Isaac Morley and George Washington Bradley to organize about fifty families to move south and settle "San Pete."  </p>
