The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Spanish_Trail_(trade_route)">Old Spanish Trail (trade route)</a> was the route they mapped, and over the course of the next hundred years the trail was used by fur trappers, hunters, government officials, and many more. This brought many people through Sevier County. Nearly 100 years later the first colonization began as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richfield,_Utah">Richfield, Utah</a> was established within the present day county boundaries. The area was colonized by the Mormon settlers on 15 June 1864.
