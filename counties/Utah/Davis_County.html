<p>Davis County was created on October 5, 1850, with Farmington designated as its county seat, because of its geographic location midway between boundaries at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_River">Weber River</a> on the north and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River_(Utah)">Jordan River</a> on the south. During its first 50 years, Davis County grew slowly. With the advent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Central_Rail_Road_(1869-1881)">Utah Central Rail Road</a> in 1870, a transition to mechanized agriculture and a surge of commerce, banking, improved roads, new water systems, and electrification of homes began. However, by 1940, the population was barely 16,000.  </p>
