<p>Davis County was created on October 5, 1850, with Farmington designated as its county seat, because of its geographic location midway between boundaries at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_River">Weber River</a> on the north and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River_(Utah)">Jordan River</a> on the south. During its first 50 years, Davis County grew slowly.
