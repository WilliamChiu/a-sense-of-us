<p>Rich County was believed to have first been visited by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_ethnic_groups">European</a> descendent explorers in 1811, when trapper Joseph Miller discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_River_(Utah)">Bear River</a>. In 1827, the first annual rendezvous of trappers occurred on the south shore of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Lake_(Utah-Idaho)">Bear Lake</a>, a tradition which is still marked today. The site is also preserved as part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Lake_State_Park_(Utah)">Bear Lake State Park</a>. The first settlement within the county's present boundary was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Valley,_Utah">Round Valley</a> in 1863; located southwest of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laketown,_Utah">Laketown</a> (settled 1864), it is now a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghost_town">ghost town</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph,_Utah">Randolph</a> was settled in 1870. Originally created as Richland County in 1864, the name was shortened to Rich in 1868 by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_Utah_Territorial_Legislature">17th Utah Territorial Legislature</a>.  The boundary as originally defined legitimately extended beyond Utah into southwestern Wyoming, but also contained populated territory within what was actually Idaho Territory.  The 1870 census for Rich County, Utah Territory enumerates a total of 1,672 residents in the eight Idaho communities of Bennington, Bloomington, Fish Haven, Liberty, Montpelier, Ovid, Paris and St. Charles.   Utah Territory adjusted the county's boundary in 1872 and Idaho Territory took the eight aforementioned communities and others in the Bear Lake Valley to form Bear Lake County on January 5, 1875.  </p>
