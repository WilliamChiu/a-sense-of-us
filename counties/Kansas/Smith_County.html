The first homestead in Smith County was in 1871 and there were 3,800 inhabitants by 1875. The county grew to 15,000 people by 1889. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize">Corn</a> was the main crop at first but drought and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grasshopper">grasshopper</a> plagues severely hurt the crops. When hardy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_wheat">Winter wheat</a> was introduced to Kansas by Russian settlers, it eventually became the predominant crop in Smith County. The population of the county has slowly declined since 1900 due in large part because of advanced farming techniques that require less human labor.  </p>
