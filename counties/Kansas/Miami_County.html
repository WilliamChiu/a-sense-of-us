<p>The first settlements of the area were by native American Indian tribes, primarily in the 1820s through the 1840s. This was due to their removal from areas east (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio">Ohio</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois">Illinois</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana">Indiana</a>)and the designation of the area as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Territory">Indian Territory</a>. The tribes included were the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_tribe">Miami</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee">Shawnee</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potawatomi">Pottawatomie</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piankeshaw">Piankeshaw</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaskaskia">Kaskaskia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wea">Wea</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria_(tribe)">Peoria</a>, which comprised the Confederated Tribes.

Early white settlers during that time were primarily serving as missionaries to the tribes.  Over time, other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pioneer">settlers</a> continued to arrive to build homes on the Miami reservation, and by 1854, the U.S. Government purchased all but 72000 acre from the Miami tribe.  </p>
