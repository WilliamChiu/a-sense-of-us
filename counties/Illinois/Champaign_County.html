The county and county seat were named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign_County,_Ohio">Champaign County</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbana,_Ohio">Urbana</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio">Ohio</a> respectively, the homeplace of the Illinois legislator who sponsored the bill to create the county.  The development of the county was greatly furthered by the arrival of the Chicago Branch of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Central_Railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</a>, and even more by the establishment of the land-grant university.  Later, the county also got an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Willard_Airport">airport</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign-Urbana_Mass_Transit_District">mass transit district</a>.
