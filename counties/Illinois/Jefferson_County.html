<p>The first settler in Jefferson County is believed to have been Andrew Moore.  In 1810, he settled near the southeast corner of the county, near where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshen_Road">Goshen Road</a> emerges from the forest of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_County,_Illinois">Hamilton County</a> into what is now known as Moore's Prairie.  It is interesting that Moore arrived from the Goshen Settlement, near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardsville,_Illinois">Edwardsville</a>.  His migration was therefore retrograde, from the west toward the interior of the State.  </p>
