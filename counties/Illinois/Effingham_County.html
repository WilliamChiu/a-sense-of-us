It may have been named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Howard,_3rd_Earl_of_Effingham">Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham</a>, who resigned his commission as general in the British army in 1775, refusing to serve in the war against the Colonies. The name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language">Anglo-Saxon</a> for "Effa's house".  New information suggests that the county was named after a surveyor who surveyed the area whose last name was Effingham.  There is no written proof that the county was named after Lord Effingham.  </p>
