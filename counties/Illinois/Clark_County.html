<p>Clark County was formed in 1819 out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawford_County,_Illinois">Crawford County</a>. At the time of its formation, Clark County included about a third of Illinois, and extended as far north as the present state of Wisconsin. In 1821 the northern part of Clark County became part of the newly created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_County,Illinois">Pike County</a> on January 31, and the newly created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayette_County,_Illinois">Fayette County</a> took the western part of Clark County on February 14. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_County,_Illinois">Edgar County</a> was created from the northern part of Clark County on January 3, 1823. The creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_County,_Illinois">Coles County</a> occupied additional land from western Clark County, effective December 25, 1830. The boundaries of Clark County have been unchanged since.  </p>
