<p>Sangamon County was formed in 1821 out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County,_Illinois">Madison</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_County,_Illinois">Bond</a> counties. The county was named for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangamon_River">Sangamon River</a>, which runs through it. The origin of the name of the river is unknown; among several explanations is the theory that is comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottawatomie">Pottawatomie</a> word Sain-guee-mon (pronounced "sang g√§ mun") meaning "where there is plenty to eat."  Published histories of neighboring Menard County (formed from Sangamon County) suggest that the name was first given to the river by the French explorers of the late 17th century as they passed through the region.  The river was named to honor "St. Gamo", or Saint Gamo, an 8th-century French Benedictine monk.  The French pronunciation "San-Gamo" is the legacy.  </p>
