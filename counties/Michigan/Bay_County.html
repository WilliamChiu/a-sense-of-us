<p>Bay County was created in 1857 from portions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_County,_Michigan">Midland County</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saginaw_County,_Michigan">Saginaw County</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arenac_County,_Michigan">Arenac County</a>.  Its name origin is that it "surrounds Saginaw Bay."  Being only sparsely populated at that time, Arenac County government was unorganized and was attached to Saginaw County for administrative purposes. There was considerable opposition to the creation of Bay County from elected officials in both Saginaw and Midland counties. In 1854, a bill introduced to the state legislature to create Bay County was defeated by a small majority.  </p>
