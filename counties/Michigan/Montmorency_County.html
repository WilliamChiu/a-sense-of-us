<p>In 1840, it was first named "Cheonoquet" after a well known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippewa">Chippewa</a> (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwa">Ojibwa</a>) Chief, whose name meant Big Cloud.  Cheonoquet took part in Indian treaties in 1807, 1815, 1825 and 1837. In 1843, the county was renamed for the Count Morenci, who aided the colonies in the war with England.  The county was organized in 1881.  The reason for the change in spelling is subject to some dispute.  ''See'' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michigan_county_name_etymologies">List of Michigan county name etymologies</a>. The name Montmorency probably means Mountain Moor.  Montmorency is very much a boggy land or moor that is at the top of a broad mount or highland. When the county was formed in 1881, some land area was taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheboygan_County,_Michigan">Cheboygan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpena_County,_Michigan">Alpena</a> counties. Three townships were divided, namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briley_Township,_Michigan">Briley</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmorency_Township,_Michigan">Montmorency</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Township,_Michigan">Rust</a>. By 1901 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Township,_Michigan">Albert</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillman_Township,_Michigan">Hillman</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Township,_Montmorency_County,_Michigan">Wheatfield</a> were added.  Brush Creek, now known as Hillman, was the first county seat.  In 1891 the county seat was moved to Atlanta.  </p>
