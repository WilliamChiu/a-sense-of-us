<p>Founded by Territorial Governor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Cass">Lewis Cass</a> in 1819, sparsely settled Oakland was originally twice its current size. As was customary at the time, as populations increased, other counties were organized from its land area. Woodward Avenue and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_and_Pontiac_Railroad">Detroit and Pontiac Railroad</a> helped draw settlers in the 1840s. By 1840, Oakland had more than fifty lumber mills, processing wood harvested from the region and the Upper Peninsula. Pontiac, located on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_River_(Michigan)">Clinton River</a>, was Oakland's first town and became the county seat. After the Civil War, Oakland was still primarily a rural, agricultural county with numerous isolated villages. By the end of the 19th century, three rail lines served Pontiac, and the city attracted carriage and wagon factories. In the late 1890s streetcars were constructed here and to Detroit.  </p>
