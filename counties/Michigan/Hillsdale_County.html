''See'' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michigan_county_name_etymologies">List of Michigan county name etymologies</a>.  Hillsdale County was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> settlement.  The original founders of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsdale,_Michigan">Hillsdale</a> consisted entirely of settlers from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a>.  These people were "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee">Yankee</a>'s", that is to say they were descended from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_American">English</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans">Puritans</a> who settled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> in the 1600s.  They were part of a wave of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territory">Northwest Territory</a> during the early 1800s.  Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal">Erie Canal</a> as well as the close of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War">Black Hawk War</a>.   When they arrived in what is now Hillsdale County there was nothing but a virgin forest and wild prairie, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_American">New Englanders</a> laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.  They brought with them many of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee">Yankee</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism.  They were mostly members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalist_Church">Congregationalist Church</a> though some were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States)">Episcopalian</a>, however as a result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> many became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists">Baptists</a> and many also converted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism">Methodism</a> before arriving in Michigan.  The people of Hillsdale County, like many others in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan">Michigan</a>, maintained a cultural affinity with early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a>.  </p>
