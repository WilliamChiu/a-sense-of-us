<p>The first settler in Kalkaska County was an Englishman named William Copeland, who purchased land in the northwest corner of the county in 1855. The county was set off in 1840 and originally called Wabasee until 1843. The name Kalkaska is thought to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippewa">Chippewa</a> word meaning flat or burned-over country. An alternative theory is that this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neologism">neologism</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neonym">neonym</a> created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Schoolcraft">Henry Schoolcraft</a>, originally spelled Calcasca.  Some theorists suggest this is word play.  Schoolcraft's family name formerly was Calcraft, and the Ks may have been added to make the name appear more like a Native American word. Logging was the first important industry. The discovery of substantial deposits of oil and natural gas resulted in the construction of a processing plant by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_Oil_Company">Shell Oil Company</a> in 1973 and a major economic boom in the community.  </p>
