<p>'''Morgan County''' was created by an act of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> in March 1820 from parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_County,_West_Virginia">Berkeley</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire_County,_West_Virginia">Hampshire</a> counties. It was named in honor of General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> (1736â€“1802). He was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunterdon_County,_New_Jersey">Hunterdon County</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester,_Virginia">Winchester</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">Virginia</a> as a youth. He served as a wagoner in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Braddock">Braddock's Army</a> during the campaign against the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native Americans</a> in 1755. During the campaign, a British Lieutenant became angry with him and hit him with the flat of his sword. Morgan punched the Lieutenant, knocking him unconscious. Morgan was court-martialed for striking a British officer and was sentenced to 500 lashes. Morgan later joked that the drummer who counted out the lashes miscounted and he received only 499 lashes. For the rest of his life he claimed the British still owed him one.  </p>
