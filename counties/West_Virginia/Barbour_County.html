<p>The first white settlement in present-day Barbour County was established in 1780 by Richard Talbott – along with his brother Cotteral and sister Charity – about three miles (5&nbsp;km) downriver from the future site of Philippi. At this time the region was still a part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongalia_County,_West_Virginia">Monongalia County</a>, Virginia. The region had had no permanent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Indian</a> settlements and so conflicts with Native Americans were relatively infrequent in the early days. Nevertheless, the Talbotts were obliged to leave their homestead several times for safety and twice found it necessary to retreat back east of the Alleghenies, returning each time. No member of this eventually large family was ever killed by Indian attacks.  </p>
