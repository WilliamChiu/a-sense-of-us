<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romney,_West_Virginia">Romney</a> was initially settled by hunters and traders around 1725. In 1738, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pearsall">John Pearsall</a> (or Pearsoll) and his brother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Pearsall">Job</a> built homes and in 1758 a fort (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pearsall">Fort Pearsall</a>) for defense against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native Americans</a> in present-day Romney. Their settlement was then known as '''Pearsall's Flats'''. In 1748, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fairfax,_6th_Lord_Fairfax_of_Cameron">Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron</a> sent a surveying party, including 16 year-old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a>, to survey his lands along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River">Potomac</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River#South_Branch_Potomac_River">South Branch Potomac</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/river">river</a>s.
