This land, which they called Can-tuc-kee, was thought to be inhabited by ghosts of Azgens, a white people from an eastern sea who were said to be killed off by the Shawnee's ancestors.  According to the legend, the area was owned by the bones and ghosts of the Azgens, who would permit responsible hunting but, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Fish">Black Fish</a>, "we are never allowed to kill the game wantonly, and we are forbidden to settle in the country...if we did, these ghosts would rise from their caves and mounds and slay us, but they would set father against son and son against father and neighbor against neighbor and make them kill one another."
