It was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, author of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> and third <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States">President of the United States</a>. Virginia previously had a Jefferson County, which was lost to form the new state of Kentucky. Accordingly, in the State records of Virginia, there will be listings for Jefferson County from 1780-1792 and Jefferson County from 1801-1863. Neither is still located in Virginia and despite naming a county after him twice, Virginia no longer has a county named for its hero Thomas Jefferson.  </p>
