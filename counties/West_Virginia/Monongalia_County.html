<p>Monongalia County takes its name from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongahela_River">Monongahela River</a>.  The name ''Monongalia'' may be a misspelling of Monongahela. Alternatively, the conventional Latinate ending "-ia" (designating "land of..." or "country of..." â€” as in ''Arabia'', ''Bolivia'' or ''Columbia'') may have been added to Monongahela (i.e., "Land of the Monongahela").  </p>
