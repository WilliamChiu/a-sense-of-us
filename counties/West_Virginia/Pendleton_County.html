<p>By the 1740s, the three main valleys of what became Pendleton County had been visited and named by white hunters and prospectors. One of the hunters, a single man named Abraham Burner, built himself a log cabin about a half mile downstream of the future site of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandywine,_West_Virginia">Brandywine</a> in 1745. He was the county's first white settler. A local historian recorded that: <blockquote>The site ...<a href="was">as</a> on the left bank of the river, and near the beginning of a long, eastward bend. From almost at his very door his huntsman's eye was at times gladdened by seeing perhaps fifty deer either drinking from the steam or plunging in their heads up to their ears in search of moss.</blockquote> By 1747, immigrants were impinging on the (future) borders of Pendleton from two directions: the larger community was mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American">Germans</a> moving up the valley of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Branch_Potomac">South Branch Potomac</a>; the lesser consisted mainly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_American">Scotch-Irish</a> moving northwest from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton,_Virginia">Staunton</a> up into the headwaters of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_River">James River</a>. In an April 1758 surprise raid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Seybert">Fort Seybert</a> and nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Upper_Tract">Fort Upper Tract</a> occasioned by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War">French and Indian War</a> (1754â€“63), most of the 60 white settlers sheltering there were massacred by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee">Shawnee</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape">Delaware</a> warriors and the forts were burned.  </p>
