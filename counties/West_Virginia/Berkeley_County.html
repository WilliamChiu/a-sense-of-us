<p>Berkeley is the second oldest county in West Virginia. The county was created by an act of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> in February 1772 from the northern third of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_County,_Virginia">Frederick County</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">Virginia</a>). At the time of the county's formation it also consisted of the areas that make up the present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_West_Virginia">Jefferson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_County,_West_Virginia">Morgan</a> counties. Most historians believe that the county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norborne_Berkeley,_Baron_de_Botetourt">Norborne Berkeley, Baron de Botetourt</a> (1718â€“1770), Colonial Governor of Virginia from 1768 to 1770. West Virginia's Blue Book, for example, indicates that Berkeley County was named in his honor. He served as a colonel in England's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Gloucestershire">North Gloucestershire</a> militia in 1761, and represented that division of the county in parliament until he was made a peer in 1764. Having incurred heavy gambling debts, he solicited a government appointment and in July 1768, was made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governor_of_Virginia">governor of Virginia</a>. In 1769, he reluctantly dissolved the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> after it adopted resolutions opposing parliament's replacement of requisitions with parliamentary taxes as a means of generating revenue and a requirement that the colonists send accused criminals to England for trial. Despite his differences with the Assembly, Berkeley was well respected by the colonists, especially after he sent Parliament letters encouraging it to repeal the taxes. When Parliament refused to rescind the taxes, Governor Berkeley requested to be recalled. In appreciation of his efforts on their behalf, the colonists erected a monument to his memory which currently stands in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Virginia">Williamsburg</a>, and two counties were later named in his honor: Berkeley in present-day West Virginia and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botetourt_County,_Virginia">Botetourt</a> in Virginia.  </p>
