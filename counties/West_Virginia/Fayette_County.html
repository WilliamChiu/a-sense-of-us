It was named in honor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_la_Fayette">Marquis de la Fayette</a>, who had played a key role assisting the Continental Army during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Virginia previously had a Fayette County, which was lost to form the new state of Kentucky. Accordingly, in the State records of Virginia, there will be listings for Fayette County from 1780â€“1792 and Fayette County from 1831-1863. Neither location is still located in Virginia and despite naming a county after him twice, Virginia no longer has a county named for the Marquis de la Fayette.  </p>
