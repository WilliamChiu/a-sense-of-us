<p>Mingo County is the newest county in the state, formed by an act of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_Legislature">state legislature</a> in 1895 from parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_County,_West_Virginia">Logan County</a>. Its founding was related to a legal protest by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moonshine">moonshine</a>r, who claimed that the Logan County Court that had found him guilty did not have jurisdiction over his case, because his still was actually located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_County,_West_Virginia">Lincoln County</a>. A land survey was taken and discovered that the defendant was correct. The charges were then refiled in Lincoln County court. Although the moonshiner was ultimately found guilty of his crime, the state legislature was made aware of the situation and determined that Logan County was too large for the expeditious administration of justice and decided to create a new county, called Mingo. The county was named in honor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingo">Mingo</a> Indians.  </p>
