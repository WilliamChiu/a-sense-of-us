<p>Lander County was one of the original nine counties created in 1861. It was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_W._Lander">Frederick W. Lander</a>, chief engineer of a federal wagon route through the area in 1857. He later served as Special Indian Agent in the area, and died during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">Virginia</a> in 1862 at the rank of brigadier general. Created in 1861, Lander County sprang forth as the result of a mining boom on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_River">Reese River</a>, along the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Express">pony express</a> line; taking a considerable portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_County,_Nevada">Churchill</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_County,_Nevada">Humboldt</a> counties with it. Eventually, Lander County would be known as the "mother of counties" since three other counties in Nevada were formed from it: Elko, White Pine, and Eureka. Its first county seat was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsville,_Nevada">Jacobsville</a> in 1862 which was soon after moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Nevada">Austin</a> in 1863 and finally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Mountain,_Nevada">Battle Mountain</a> in 1979.  </p>
