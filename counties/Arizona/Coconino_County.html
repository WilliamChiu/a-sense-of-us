<p>After the building of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_&_Pacific_Railroad">Atlantic & Pacific Railroad</a> in 1883 the region of northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai_County">Yavapai County</a> began experiencing rapid growth. The people of the northern reaches had tired of the rigors of travelling all the way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona">Prescott</a> for county business. They also believed that they were a significant enough entity that they should have their own county jurisdiction. Therefore, they decided in 1887 to petition for secession from Yavapai and the creation of a new Frisco County. They remained part of Yavapai, however, until 1891 when Coconino County was formed and its seat declared to be Flagstaff. Sedona was founded in 1902 and there were 52 residents at the time.  </p>
