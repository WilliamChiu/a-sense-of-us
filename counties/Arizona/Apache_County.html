<p>Apache County was formed during the Tenth Territorial Legislation in 1879 out of the eastern section of Yavapai County; officially all land east of 119^o 45'.  By 1895, Navajo County and parts of Graham, Greenlee and Gila Counties were formed from this land.  The county seat was placed in the town of Snowflake, but was moved a year later to St. Johns.  From 1880 to 1882, the county seat was temporarily in Springerville before being returned to St. Johns.  </p>
