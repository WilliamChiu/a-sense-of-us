It was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wilmer_Dallam">James Wilmer Dallam</a>, the lawyer who made the first digest of Texas laws. The first settlement in the area followed in 1870, which resulted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_War">Red River War</a> of 1874 and 1875 with the native Comanche and Kiowa tribes.
