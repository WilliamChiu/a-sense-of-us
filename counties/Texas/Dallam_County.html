<p>Dallam County was formed in 1876 from portions of Bexar County. It was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wilmer_Dallam">James Wilmer Dallam</a>, the lawyer who made the first digest of Texas laws. The first settlement in the area followed in 1870, which resulted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_War">Red River War</a> of 1874 and 1875 with the native Comanche and Kiowa tribes. In 1900-01, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago,_Rock_Island_and_Pacific_Railroad">Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad</a> company built a stretch from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enid,_Oklahoma">Enid, Oklahoma</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucumcari,_New_Mexico">Tucumcari, New Mexico</a>, which ran through the county. The location where the tracks met those of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_and_Denver_Railway">Fort Worth and Denver Railway</a> was named Dalhart. The name is taken from the first letters of Dallam County and Hartley County, between which the town's area is divided. Within a short time, the small railroad stop turned into a sizable town and was named county seat in 1903.   </p>
