<p>The first declaration of independence for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Texas">Republic of Texas</a> was signed in Goliad on December 20, 1835, although the formal declaration was made by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_1836">Convention of 1836</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington-on-the-Brazos,_Texas">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a>. Goliad County was the site of two battles in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Goliad">Battle of Goliad</a> was a minor skirmish early in the war. However the subsequent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_Coleto">battle of Coleto</a> was an important battle that culminated on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliad_Campaign">March 27, 1836</a>. Col. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fannin">James Fannin</a> and his Texan soldiers were executed by the Mexican army, under orders from Gen. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_López_de_Santa_Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a>, in what became known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliad_Massacre">Goliad Massacre</a>. This event led to the Texas Revolutionary battle cry "Remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamo">Alamo</a>! Remember Goliad!" Although many remember the Alamo today, fewer remember Goliad. The site of the massacre is located in Goliad State Park, just south of the town of Goliad.  </p>
