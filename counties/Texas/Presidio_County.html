The Masames tribe was exterminated by the Tobosos, circa 1652.  The Nonojes suffered from clashes with the Spanish and merged with the Tobosos.  The Spanish made slave raids to the La Junta de los RÃ­os, committing cruelties against the native population.

The tribe later merged with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache">Apache</a> people. Foraging peoples who did not survive the 18th Century include the Chisos, Mansos, Jumanos, Conchos, Julimes, Cibolos, Tobosos, Sumas, Cholomes, Caguates, Nonojes, Cocoyames, and Acoclames.  </p>
