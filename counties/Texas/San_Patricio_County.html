<p>In 1828, 200 Irish Catholic families, recruited from Ireland and the Irish population of New York City, contracted with the Mexican government to settle on 80 leagues of land in this area. By 1836, about 500 people lived in the colony on 84 Mexican land grants. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>, most fled from colony was because of fighting in the area. By 1841, a small number of permanent residents had returned. When Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845, the area was stabilized by the presence of U.S. troops under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor">Gen. Zachary Taylor</a>. In 1845, Corpus Christi was designated as the county seat. The following year, the county south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueces_River">Nueces River</a> was reorganized as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueces_County,_Texas">Nueces County</a>, and San Patricio became its county seat. In 1848, additional counties were formed out of San Patricio, which further reduced its size.  </p>
