<p>Davidson County is the oldest county in the 41-county region of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Tennessee">Middle Tennessee</a>. It dates to 1783, when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina">North Carolina</a> legislature created the county and named it in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_Davidson">William Lee Davidson</a>, a North Carolina general who was killed opposing General Cornwallis and the British Army's crossing of the Catawba River on February 1, 1781.

The first white settlers established the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Compact">Cumberland Compact</a> in order to establish a basic rule of law and to protect their land titles. Through much of the early 1780s, the settlers also faced a hostile response from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</a> tribes who resented their encroaching on their territory and competing for resources. As the county's many known archaeological sites attest, Native American cultures had occupied areas of Davidson County for thousands of years. The first whites to enter the area were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fur_traders">fur traders</a>.
