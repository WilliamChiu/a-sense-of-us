<p>What is today Blount County was for many thousands of years Indian territory, passed down to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee">Cherokee</a> tribe that claimed the land upon the arrival of white settlers in the late 18th century. Shortly thereafter, on July 11, 1795, Blount County became the tenth county established in Tennessee, when the Territorial Legislature voted to split adjacent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_County,_Tennessee">Knox</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Tennessee">Jefferson</a> counties. The new county was named for the governor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Territory">Southwest Territory</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blount">William Blount</a>, and its county seat, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryville,_Tennessee">Maryville</a>, was named for his wife Mary Grainger Blount. This establishment, however, did little to settle the differences between white immigrants and Cherokee natives, which was, for the most part, not accomplished until an 1819 treaty.  </p>
