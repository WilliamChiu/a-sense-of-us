<p>Before the formation of Anderson County, Tennessee, that territory was initially land of what is today called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Band_of_Cherokee_Indians">Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians</a>, which had been settled by several pioneer families including the Wallace, Gibbs, Freels, Frost and Tunnell families.  Although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Holston">Treaty of Holston</a>, signed in 1791, was intended as a negotiation with the Cherokee to prohibit settlement of the area including what is today Anderson County, the treaty became ineffective as more settlers moved through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> from Virginia and North Carolina into Tennessee.  The flooding of white settlers into the Indian domain was cause for several skirmishes, which eased after the Treaty of Tellico in 1798 (with an origination point for relinquished land from the Cherokee being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellico_Blockhouse">Tellico Blockhouse</a>) allowed for greater ease in settling the area.  </p>
