<p>Chester County was the last county formed in Tennessee, created by the General Assembly in 1875 from adjacent parts of neighboring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeman_County,_Tennessee">Hardeman</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson_County,_Tennessee">Henderson</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNairy_County,_Tennessee">McNairy</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County,_Tennessee">Madison</a> counties. This land was used to create a county named Wisdom County, but "Wisdom County" was never organized, and in March 1879 the Assembly repealed this and created Chester County out of the same land.  Lawsuits by opponents of the creation of the new county delayed actual organization until 1882. Chester County was named for Colonel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_I._Chester">Robert I.
