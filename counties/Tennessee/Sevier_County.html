In the mid-16th century, Spanish expeditions led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernando_de_Soto_(explorer)">Hernando de Soto</a> (1540) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pardo_(explorer)">Juan Pardo</a> (1567) passed through what is now Sevier County, reporting that the region was part of the domain of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaha">Chiaha</a>, a minor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskogean_language">Muskogean</a> chiefdom centered around a village located on a now-submerged island just upstream from modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Dam">Douglas Dam</a>.
