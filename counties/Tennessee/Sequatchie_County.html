<p>Sequatchie County was created in 1857 from a portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_County,_Tennessee">Hamilton County</a>.  It was named for the Sequatchie Valley, which in turn had been named for a Cherokee chief.  The word ''sequachee'' in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_language">Cherokee</a> means, "opossum" or "he grins or runs."  Settlers began arriving in what is now Sequatchie by the early 19th century, drawn to the area by the fertile land in the valley.  </p>
