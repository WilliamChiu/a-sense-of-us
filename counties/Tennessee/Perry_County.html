<p>Perry County was formed in 1819 from parts of Humphreys and Hickman counties. It is named in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Hazard_Perry">Oliver Hazard Perry</a> (1785â€“1819), American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812">War of 1812</a> naval officer who, after his flagship was severely damaged, continued the fight from another ship and forced the surrender of the British fleet at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Erie">Battle of Lake Erie</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decatur_County,_Tennessee">Decatur County</a> was formed from the portions of Perry County west of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_River">Tennessee River</a>.  The first settlements in the county were along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toms_Creek_(Tennessee_River)">Toms Creek</a> near the Tennessee River, with the first known birth in the area occurring in 1818.  This is the first written date involving the area that would become Perry County, but it is evident that the area had some European permanent settlement prior to this. The seat of government and courts were originally located in a small town known as Harrisburg approximately 4 mi south of the current seat of Linden.  The county seat was transferred to its current location in Linden in 1848, where the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_County_Courthouse_(Tennessee)">courthouse</a> stands today.  Harrisburg no longer exists as a municipal entity or recognized location.  </p>
