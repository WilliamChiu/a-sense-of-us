<p>Shelby County was established by European-American migrants in 1819.  The county was part of the lands acquired by the United States government from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a> as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Purchase_of_1818">Jackson Purchase of 1818</a>.  The county was named for Isaac Shelby, the former governor of Kentucky who had helped negotiate the land acquisition.  From 1826 to 1868, the county seat was located at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_Tennessee">Raleigh, Tennessee</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_River_(West_Tennessee)">Wolf River</a>; after the American Civil War, in recognition of the growth of Memphis, it was moved there. (Raleigh is now within the city limits of Memphis.) The lowlands in the Mississippi Delta, closest to the Mississippi River, were developed for large cotton plantations; their laborers were overwhelmingly enslaved African Americans. Well before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a>, the population of the county was majority black and mostly slaves. Memphis developed as a major cotton market, with many brokers.  </p>
