The fort was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Campbell,_4th_Earl_of_Loudoun">John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun</a> and a commander of British forces during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_Wars">French and Indian Wars</a>.  In August 1870, the county officers were chosen. On September 5, 1870, the county court was organized at the Baptist Church in Loudon. This church became the temporary quarters of the county court until the new building, built by J. W. Clark & Brothers, was finished in 1872.  </p>
