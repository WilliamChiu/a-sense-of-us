<p>When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Territory">Washington Territory</a> was organized in 1853, the Kitsap Peninsula was divided between King County to the east and Jefferson County to the west. Official public papers were required to be filed at the county seat, which meant Peninsula business people had to travel to either Seattle or Port Townsend to transact business. On the understanding that they would "bring home a new county," area mill operators <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Anson_Meigs">George Meigs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Renton">William Renton</a> supported the candidacies to the Territorial Legislature of two employees from their respective mills: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Duane_Hinckley">Timothy Duane Hinckley</a> from that of Meigs and S.B. Wilson from Renton's.  </p>
