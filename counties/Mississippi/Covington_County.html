<p>Covington County was established on January 5, 1819, less than two years after Mississippi earned statehood into the Union.  The county was one of the first counties established out of the vast non-agricultural lands in the more eastern part of the state.  Covington was originally cut out of Lawrence and Wayne Counties, and encompassed what is now Jefferson Davis, Covington, and Jones Counties.  </p>
