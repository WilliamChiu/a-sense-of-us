<p>Sunflower Country was created in 1844. The land mass encompassed most of Sunflower and Leflore Counties as we know them today. The first seat of government was Clayton, located near Fort Pemberton. Later the county seat was moved to McNutt, also in the Leflore County of today. When Sunflower and Leflore Counties were separated in 1871, the new county seat for Sunflower County was moved to Johnsonville. This village was located where the north end of Mound Bayou empties into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_River">Sunflower River</a>. In 1882 the county seat was moved to Eureka, which was later renamed Indianola.  </p>
