European-American settlers did not enter this area to develop it much as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cotton">cotton</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantations">plantations</a> until after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal">Indian Removal</a> in the 1830s. Using enslaved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans">African Americans</a> as laborers, planters created long, narrow plantations that fronted on the Mississippi to the west and the Big Black River to the north, the transportation byways. As in other parts of the state, the bottomlands areas were undeveloped until after the American Civil War. Planters brought numerous enslaved African Americans here, who were chiefly transported from the Upper South in a forced migration to the Deep South; well before the Civil War, the county had a majority-black population.  </p>
