<p>Flathead County was founded in 1893. It was named for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flathead_Indians">Salish (Flathead) Indians</a>. The name originated with the early settlers who called several different tribes of Indians by this name on account of their custom of flattening the heads of infants by fastening a piece of board or a pad of grass upon the forehead. After this had been worn several months it caused a flat appearance of the head.  </p>
