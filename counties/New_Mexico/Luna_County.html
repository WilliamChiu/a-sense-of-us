The invaders raided and burned much of the town, causing many residents to flee to the desert.  Although the raid completely surprised everyone in the town, it also awakened 350 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army">United States Army</a> soldiers at Camp Furlong at the edge of town, who defended the town with two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/machine_gun">machine gun</a>s.  The fighting continued until dawn, when Villa fled back across the Mexican border, five hours after invading and approximately ninety minutes after attacking the town.
