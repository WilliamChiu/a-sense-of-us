<p>After a dispute over the 1819 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams-Onís_Treaty">Adams-Onís Treaty</a> and the related 1828 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Limits_(Mexico–United_States)">Treaty of Limits</a>, the governments of both the United States and the state of Texas claimed ownership of some 1.5 million acres (6,000&nbsp;km²) in what was then operated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greer_County,_Texas">Greer County, Texas</a>. The county was named for former Texas lieutenant governor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Greer">John A. Greer</a>. Litigation followed, and in the case of ''United States v. State of Texas'' , issued on March 16, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">Supreme Court</a>, having original jurisdiction over the case, decided in favor of the United States.  The county was then assigned to the Oklahoma Territory on May 4, 1896, and when Oklahoma became a state, in addition to becoming Greer County, the region was also further split into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmon_County,_Oklahoma">Harmon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Oklahoma">Jackson</a>, and part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckham_County,_Oklahoma">Beckham</a> counties. The town of Mangum was designated as the county seat in 1886, while the county was still part of Texas, and has remained the county seat ever since.  </p>
