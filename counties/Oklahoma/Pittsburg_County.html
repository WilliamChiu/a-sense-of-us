<p>The area forms the present Pittsburg county was part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctaw_Nation">Choctaw Nation</a> after the Choctaw tribe was forced to relocate to Indian Territory from its home in the Southeastern United States in the early 1830s. Some important trails, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Road">Texas Road</a> and one route of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Trail">California Trail</a> passed through it. In 1840, James Perry established a village called Perryville that became an important stop near the place where the two trails crossed. During the Civil War, Perryville served as an important supply depot for Confederate forces until the Union Army captured and burned the town. It became defunct after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri,_Kansas_and_Texas_Railway">Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway</a> (MK&T) bypassed it in 1872, and the remaining inhabitants moved to McAlester. The Butterfield Overland Mail route followed a route through this area.  </p>
