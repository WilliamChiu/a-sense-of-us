<p>For millennia, the land now known as Oklahoma was inhabited by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native Americans</a>.  The ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'' states that archaeological evidence indicates that humans first lived in this area in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdigris_River">Verdigris River</a> valley over six thousand years ago.  In the 17th century, white trappers first visiting the area found it occupied mostly by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_Nation">Osage</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quapaw">Quapaw</a> tribes.  It was recognized as Osage territory by the time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> secured it as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> in 1803.  In 1819, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Territory">Arkansas Territory</a> was organized, then was split in 1824 and 1828.  An 1828 treaty with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_Nation">Cherokee Nation</a> assigned the area of Nowata County to the Cherokees, who included it in 1856 in their newly created Cooweescoowee District. The Cherokees and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware">Delaware</a> signed a treaty in 1867 that resulted in Delaware settlements near the present towns of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware,_Oklahoma">Delaware</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenapah,_Oklahoma">Lenapah</a> and Nowata, Oklahoma.    </p>
