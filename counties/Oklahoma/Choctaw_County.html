<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctaw_Nation">Choctaw Nation</a> moved into the area now occupied by Choctaw County in 1831 &ndash; 32, as a result of their forcible expulsion from the Southeastern United States. The U. S. Army had already established <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Towson">Fort Towson</a> in the area in 1824, and took on the mission of protecting the newcomers from other tribes. In 1837, the Chickasaws settled the area around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doaksville,_Choctaw_Nation">Doaksville</a>, which was adjacent to the fort. Both the town of Fort Towson and Doaksville served as the capital of the Choctaw Nation. Doaksville became a ghost town after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a>. In 1848, the Presbyterian church established a mission, which still exists and is now known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodland_Academy">Goodland Academy</a>.  </p>
