<p>The eastern part of what is now Cotton County was opened to settlement by non-native Americans by the 1901 Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Opening, which distributed land by a lottery system. In 1906, the remainder of the present county, then known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Pasture">Big Pasture</a> was opened through a sealed bid process. Most of this territory became part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_County,_Oklahoma">Comanche County</a> at statehood in 1907.  </p>
