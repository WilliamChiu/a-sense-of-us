<p>The area now included in McCurtain County was part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctaw_Nation">Choctaw Nation</a> before Oklahoma became a state. In the 1820s, it was a major part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_County,_Arkansas">Miller County, Arkansas</a>. The area was sparsely populated, with no roads or bridges and no towns. There were post offices established at small trading posts along the various trails. Towns began to form when the Arkansas and Choctaw Railway (later the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_and_San_Francisco_Railway">St. Louis and San Francisco Railway</a>) was built across the area in 1902. Between 1910 and 1921 the Choctaw Lumber Company laid tracks for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas,_Oklahoma_and_Eastern_Railroad">Texas, Oklahoma and Eastern Railroad</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valliant,_Oklahoma">Valliant, Oklahoma</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeQueen,_Arkansas">DeQueen, Arkansas</a>. These roads still served the area at the beginning of the 21st Century.  </p>
