<p>In 1892, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Commission">Jerome Commission</a> began enrolling the Kiowas, Comanches and Apaches to prepare for the opening of their reservation to settlement by whites. Dennis Flynn, the territorial representative to the U. S. Congress, proposed holding a lottery for opening the reservation. He argued successfully that the lottery would be safer and more orderly than land runs used earlier. Individuals could register at offices in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawton,_Oklahoma">Lawton</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Reno,_Oklahoma">El Reno</a>. 165,000 individuals registered for 13,000 160-acre claims. The drawing was held August 6, 1901. After the opening, the area was designated as Kiowa County in Oklahoma Territory. The town of Hobart, named for Vice President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_A._Hobart">Garrett A. Hobart</a>, was designated as county seat.  </p>
