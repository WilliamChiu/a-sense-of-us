The Osage became established as a powerful nation in the areas of present-day Missouri and Arkansas between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River">Missouri River</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_(Mississippi)">Red rivers</a>, as well as extending to the west.  By 1760, they had increased their range to include the present Osage County. Historically one of the most powerful Great Plains tribes, their numbers were reduced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infectious_disease">infectious disease</a> and warfare after encounter with Europeans.  </p>
