<p>In 1855, the U.S. government leased the western part of the Choctaw and Chickasaw lands, which became known as the Leased District. After the Civil War, the two nations were forced to cede the land to the government. In 1869, the former Leased District was designated by the President as the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation. During the 1880s, Texas cattlemen leased grazing land from the Cheyennes and Arapahos. In 1892, the land was opened to non-Indian settlement. The area then was designated as County F in the newly created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Territory">Oklahoma Territory</a>, until it was renamed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Mills_County,_Oklahoma">Roger Mills County</a>.
