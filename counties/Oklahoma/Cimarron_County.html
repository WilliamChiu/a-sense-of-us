<p>Cimarron County was created at statehood in 1907. Before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Organic_Act">Oklahoma Organic Act</a> was passed in 1890, the area had belonged to what was known as 'No Man's Land", also known as the "Public Land Strip." This was a relatively lawless area, with no organized government. It attracted many outlaws to seek refuge here. In 1890, the strip became known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Oklahoma">Beaver County</a>, Oklahoma Territory. Informally, it was known as the "Oklahoma Panhandle." There were only two communities in the strip. One, Carrizo, had 83 residents in 1890, while the other, Mineral City, had 93 residents. Otherwise, the land was used primarily by sheepherders from New Mexico.  </p>
