<p>The Chickasaw tribe began moving into this area in 1837, when the land had already been assigned to the Choctaws by the U.S. government. In 1855, the area became part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw_Nation">Chickasaw Nation</a>, after the two tribes officially separated. The present McClain County became part of Pontotoc County, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw_Nation">Chickasaw Nation</a> and remained such until Oklahoma attained statehood. Few Chickasaws lived here because of hostilities with western tribes (e.g., Kiowa). Major Richard Mason established Camp Holmes (also called Camp Mason) in 1835, near the present city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Oklahoma">Lexington</a>, while negotiating a treaty between the western tribes and the newly arrived Choctaws. Federal troops abandoned the camp in August 1835, after the Treaty of Camp Holmes was signed.  </p>
