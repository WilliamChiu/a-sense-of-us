Fairview, which had been settled following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Run_of_1893">Land Run of 1893</a>, was designated the county seat and voters reaffirmed the choice on December 22, 1908. The county's commissioners rented office space until a brick courthouse was constructed. A second courthouse, made of stone, was erected in 1928.  </p>
