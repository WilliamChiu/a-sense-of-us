<p>The land where Beaver County is located has been under several jurisdictions.  At one time, it was part of Texas before Texas became a state of the United States. Then in the Compromise of 1850, Texas ceded the land that would eventually become the Oklahoma panhandle to the United States government. The area was known as "No Man's Land" because it belonged to no state or territorial government. There was a period of time (1886 - 1890) that it was  a separate organized territory, known as Cimarron Territory.  After becoming part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Territory">Oklahoma Territory</a> in 1890, Beaver County (first called Seventh County) covered the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Panhandle">Oklahoma Panhandle</a>. At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state">statehood</a> in 1907, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimarron_County">Cimarron County</a> was taken from the western one-third, while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_County,_Oklahoma">Texas County</a> was taken from the middle, leaving Beaver County only in the east. Its borders are now at 100째W (east), 37째N (north), 36.5째N (south), and approximately 100.8째W (west).  </p>
