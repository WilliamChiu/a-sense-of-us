<p>Texas County was formed at Oklahoma statehood (16 November 1907) from the central one-third of "Old Beaver County". When the formation of the county was authorized by the Constitutional Convention of 1907, the county was so named because it was wholly included within the limits of the Texas Cession of 1850, whereby the ownership of the area was passed from the State of Texas to the United States Government. From 1850 to 1890, its lands were never attached to any state or territory, never surveyed, and never divided into townships and sections like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Oklahoma">eastern counties were</a>. From 1890 to 1907, it was part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Oklahoma">Beaver County</a>.  </p>
