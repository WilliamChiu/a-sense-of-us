<p>Lawrence County was created on March 20, 1849, from parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania">Beaver</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_Pennsylvania">Mercer</a> counties due to the rapid growth of New Castle, which was primarily in Mercer County but was rapidly expanding into Beaver County. The former borders between Beaver and Mercer Counties are still evident in Lawrence County today, as the northern borders of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Beaver_Township,_Lawrence_County,_Pennsylvania">North Beaver Township</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenango_Township,_Lawrence_County,_Pennsylvania">Shenango Township</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_Rock_Township,_Lawrence_County,_Pennsylvania">Slippery Rock Township</a> with (respectively) the southern borders of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahoning_Township,_Lawrence_County,_Pennsylvania">Mahoning Township</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hickory_Township,_Lawrence_County,_Pennsylvania">Hickory Township</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Township,_Lawrence_County,_Pennsylvania">Scott Township</a> make up the former boundaries between Beaver and Mercer Counties. In addition, County Line Road in New Castle where the Lawrence County Courthouse is located also marks the former boundaries.  </p>
