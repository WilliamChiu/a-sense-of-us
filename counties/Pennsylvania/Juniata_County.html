<p>Juniata County was historically a part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_County,_Pennsylvania">Cumberland County</a> and later Mifflin County. Juniata County was formed on March 2, 1831, from parts of Mifflin County. It is named after the Juniata River. The word "juniata" itself is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_language">Seneca</a> word that means either "people of the standing stone" or "blue waters". The first boroughs in the county to be settled were Mifflintown and Thompsontown, which were settled in 1790. Port Royal and Mifflin were settled in 1812 and 1848, respectively. The first of these borough to be incorporated was Mifflintown, on March 6, 1833. The last one to be incorporated was Thompsontown, on February 7, 1868. However, squatters arrived in the county and were removed from it considerably earlier, by 1750 and one of the first warrants for land in the county was issued in 1755. Many of the earliest landowners in Delaware Township were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speculator">speculator</a>s as opposed to settlers. There was an Indian raid in the county in 1755 and 1756, although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Bingham">Fort Bingham</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Peterson">Fort Peterson</a> had been constructed. The Beale family was one of the earliest families to inhabit the county. More settlers arrived in the 1750s and 1760s and the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gristmill">gristmill</a> on the western side of the Juniata River was built in the county in 1767. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_road">public road</a> was built in the county between Tuscarora Creek and a location near Shade Mountain in 1768. John Hamilton constructed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sawmill">sawmill</a> and gristmill on Cocalamus Creek in Delaware Township in 1776. The first known physician in the county, Dr. Ezra Doty, settled in Mifflintown in 1791.  </p>
