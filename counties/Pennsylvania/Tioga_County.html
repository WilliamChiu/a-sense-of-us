<p>The county was originally settled by immigrants of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee">Yankee</a>" stock  (immigrants from New England and the western part of New York descended from the English Puritans whose ancestors settled New England in the colonial era).  With the opening of a rough wagon road to the source of the Tioga River, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> settlers poured over the Allegheny Mountains.   Tioga County resembled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upstate_New_York">upstate New York</a> more than it did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> with its population primarily consisting of settlers from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a>.  Roads were laid out, post routes established, public buildings erected and people were invited to move there.  The original settlers were entirely of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> origins or were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee">Yankee</a>s from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upstate_New_York">upstate New York</a> whose families had moved to that place from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> only one generation earlier, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War.  This resulted in Tioga County being culturally contiguous with early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a> culture.  </p>
