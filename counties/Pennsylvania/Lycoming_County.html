The following counties have been formed from land that was once part of Lycoming County: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_County,_Pennsylvania">Armstrong</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_County,_Pennsylvania">Bradford</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_County,_Pennsylvania">Centre</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearfield_County,_Pennsylvania">Clearfield</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_County,_Pennsylvania">Clinton</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_County,_Pennsylvania">Indiana</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Pennsylvania">Jefferson</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKean_County,_Pennsylvania">McKean</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter_County,_Pennsylvania">Potter</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_County,_Pennsylvania">Sullivan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania">Tioga</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venango_County,_Pennsylvania">Venango</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_County,_Pennsylvania">Warren</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_County,_Pennsylvania">Forest</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_County,_Pennsylvania">Elk</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_County,_Pennsylvania">Cameron</a>. Lycoming County was originally named Jefferson County in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. This name proved to be unsatisfactory.
