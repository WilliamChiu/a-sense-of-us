<p>The first Europeans in Fayette County were explorers, who used an ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">American Indian</a> trail that bisected the county on their journey across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>. In 1754, when ownership the area was still in dispute, 22-year-old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a> fought against the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">French</a> at Jumonville Glen and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Necessity">Fort Necessity</a>. British forces under Washington and General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Braddock">Edward Braddock</a> improved roads throughout the region, making the future Fayette County an important supply route. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">American Revolution</a>, Fayette County was plagued by attacks from British-allied Indians and remained an isolated frontier region. Also retarding settlement was a border dispute with Virginia; Virginia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_West_Augusta">District of West Augusta</a> and Pennsylvania's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmoreland_County,_Pennsylvania">Westmoreland County</a> both claimed the area. In 1780 the dispute was settled in favor of Pennsylvania, and Fayette County was formed from Westmoreland County in 1783.  </p>
