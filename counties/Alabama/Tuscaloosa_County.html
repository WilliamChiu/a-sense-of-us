<p>Tuscaloosa County was established on February 6, 1818. During the antebellum years, the principal crop was cotton, cultivated and processed by African-American slaves. By 1860, shortly before the state seceded from the Union, the county had a total of 12,971 whites, 84 "free colored" and 10,145 slaves; the latter comprised 43.7 percent of the total population. The war brought significant changes, including migration out of the county by blacks. "By the 1870 census, the white population of Tuscaloosa County had decreased about 9% to 11,787, while the "colored" population decreased about 19% to 8,294." Some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedmen">freedmen</a> moved to nearby counties and larger cities for more opportunities and to join with other freedmen in communities less subject to white supervision.  </p>
