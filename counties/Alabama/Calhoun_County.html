<p>'''Benton County''' was established on December 18, 1832, named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_(senator)">Thomas Hart Benton</a>, a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate">United States Senate</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri">Missouri</a>, with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/county_seat">county seat</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Alabama">Jacksonville</a>. Benton, a slave owner, was a political ally of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>, another slaveholder and a U.S. senator from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</a>. Through the 1820s-1840s, however, Benton's and Calhoun's political interests diverged, with Calhoun increasingly using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secession">secession</a> as a weapon to maintain and expand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery">slavery</a> throughout the United States. Benton, on the other hand, was slowly coming to the conclusion that slavery was wrong and that preservation of the union was paramount. On January 29, 1858, Alabama supporters of slavery, objecting to Benton's change of heart, renamed Benton County as '''Calhoun County.''' The county seat was moved to Anniston after years of controversy and a State Supreme Court ruling in June 1900.
