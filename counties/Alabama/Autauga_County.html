<p>Autauga County was established on November 21, 1818, by an act of Alabama Territorial Legislature (one year before Alabama was admitted as a State). As established, the county included present-day Autauga County, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmore_County,_Alabama">Elmore County</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilton_County,_Alabama">Chilton County</a>. At the time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autauga_(tribe)">Autauga</a> (aka, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawasa_(tribe)">Tawasa</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Indians</a> lived here, primarily in a village named ''Atagi'' (meaning "pure water") situated on the banks of a creek by the same name (called "Pearl Water Creek" by settlers). Autaugas were members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_(people)">Alibamu</a> tribe. They sent many warriors to resist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s invasion in the Creek War. This county was part of the territory ceded by the Creeks in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Jackson">Treaty of Fort Jackson</a> in 1814. The first county seat was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson's_Mill,_Alabama">Jackson's Mill</a>, but the court only met there long enough to select a permanent seat at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_Alabama">Washington</a>, built on the former site of Atagi in the southeast corner of the county. In 1830 the county seat was moved to a more central location at Kingston and the town of Washington dwindled until it was completely deserted in the late 1830s.  </p>
