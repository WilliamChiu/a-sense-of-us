<p>Clay County was established on December 7, 1866 from land taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_County,_Alabama">Randolph</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talladega_County,_Alabama">Talladega</a> County. Named after the famous statesman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay">Henry Clay</a>, the county seat itself was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashland,_the_Henry_Clay_estate">his estate</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky">Lexington</a>, Kentucky called "Ashland". The county was covered with a heavy growth of trees, and a part of the territory was occupied by the Creek Indians. The early pioneers acquired the lands by government entry, and the Indian lands by public auction. The families came wholly from Fayette County, Georgia. Clay County was formed for geographic reasons. The citizens of the area had a difficult time reaching the county seat of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedowee">Wedowee</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_County,_Alabama">Randolph County</a> because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallapoosa_River">Tallapoosa River</a> to the east. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talladega,_Alabama">Talladega</a> was difficult to reach because of the intervening mountains. Even today, Clay County is one of only three counties in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama">Alabama</a> to have no U.S. Highways in its boundaries.  Ashland was a mining center, particularly for graphite.  </p>
