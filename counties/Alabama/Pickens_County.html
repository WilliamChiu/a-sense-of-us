<p>Pickens County was established on December 20, 1820, and named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">revolutionary war</a> hero General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Pickens_(congressman)">Andrew Pickens</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</a>. The county seat was relocated from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickensville,_Alabama">Pickensville</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrollton,_Alabama">Carrollton</a> in 1830. The first courthouse in Carrollton was burned on April 5, 1865, by troops of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_army">Union</a> General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Croxton">John T. Croxton</a>. A second courthouse was also destroyed by fire on November 16, 1876. Though arson was suspected, no arrest was made until January 1878, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wells_(prisoner)">Henry Wells</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American">African American</a> with some criminal history was arrested and locked in the garett of the new building, which had been erected in 1877. According to legend, Wells was peering down from the north garett window as a mob gathered to hang him. A bolt of lightning struck nearby and "etched" Wells' anguished face into the window glass. A vague image resembling a face can still be seen in that lower right-hand pane of that window.
