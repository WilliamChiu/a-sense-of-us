<p>On December 13, 1799, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_General_Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> passed legislation to form Floyd County as the 40th county of Kentucky. The county was made from parts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleming_County,_Kentucky">Fleming</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Kentucky">Montgomery</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_County,_Kentucky">Mason County, Kentucky</a>. The legislation became effective on June 1, 1800. The county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_John_Floyd">James John Floyd</a>, a pioneer surveyor who helped lay out the city of Louisville. The county seat was Preston's Station, later renamed Prestonsburg. The first court house burned down on April 8, 1808, destroying all the early records, so the earliest records of government activity do not date prior to 1808. Prestonsburg was used as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army">Confederate</a> stronghold during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a> and two battles took place nearby, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ivy_Mountain">Battle of Ivy Mountain</a> on November 8, 1861 and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Middle_Creek">Battle of Middle Creek</a> on January 10, 1862. Both were Union victories.  </p>
