<p>Washington County is one of several Vermont counties created from land ceded by the state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> on January 15, 1777 when Vermont declared itself to be a distinct state from New York. The land originally was contested by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland">New Netherland</a>, but it remained undelineated until July 20, 1764 when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom">King George III</a> established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_River">Connecticut River</a>, north of Massachusetts and south of the parallel of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_parallel_north">45 degrees north latitude</a>. New York assigned the land gained to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_County,_New_York">Albany County</a>. On March 12, 1772 Albany County was partitioned to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_County,_Province_of_New_York">Charlotte County</a>, and this situation remained until Vermont's independence from New York and Britain.  </p>
