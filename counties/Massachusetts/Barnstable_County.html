<p>Cape Cod is described in a letter from the Italian explorer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_da_Verrazzano">Giovanni da Verrazzano</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France">Francis I of France</a>, relating the details of a voyage to the New World made on behalf of the French crown in the ship, Dauphine, the only surviving of a fleet of four.  Sailing from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira">Madeira</a> in 1524, the Dauphine made land in North Carolina in March. It sailed north to Newfoundland, mapping the coast and interviewing the natives, whom he found friendly south of the cape, but unfriendly north of it. To the north of an island that reminded Verrazzano of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, the Dauphine made its way with difficulty over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shoal">shoal</a>s "never less than three feet deep" extending "from the continent fifty leagues out to sea," which Brevoort, based on their extent, has identified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket_Shoals">Nantucket Shoals</a>. Verrazzano  called them Armellini. On the other side was a promontory, Pallavisino, which is probably the cape, as they sailed along it for "fifty leagues." Details of the north end are not given, but subsequently they came to a "high country, full of very dense forests, composed of pines," which, according to Brevoort and others, resembles the coast of Maine.  </p>
