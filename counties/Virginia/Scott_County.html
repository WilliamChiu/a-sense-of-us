<p>The early settlers found evidence of a former native village at the mouth of Stony Creek on the Clinch river. Thomas McCulloch was the first white settler within the county, in 1769.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Boone">Daniel Boone</a> commanded several forts located here in 1774 during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunmore's_War">Dunmore's War</a>, and several more were built in successive years. Even so, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickamauga_Cherokee">Chickamauga Cherokee</a> leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Benge">Bob Benge</a> remained active in the area throughout this time, during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickamauga_wars">Chickamauga wars</a>, up until he was killed in 1794. By the times houses were built in the 1790s, the largely Scots-Irish population had increased by reason of its situation along the Wilderness Road. After Scott County was formed in 1814, the first court took place in 1815, and the first public schools in 1870.  </p>
