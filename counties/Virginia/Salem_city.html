<p>The earliest history of Salem exists as archaeological evidence of Native American tribes from as far back as 8000 B.C. until the middle of the 18th century. Europeans first explored the area of Salem in 1671, when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siouan_languages">Siouan</a>-speaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutelo_people">Totero</a> people had a village nearby. Explorers Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam gave the area its first recorded name: Totero Town, after this tribe, who supplied them with a guide to help with further exploration. Fort Lewis, named for General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lewis_(soldier)">Andrew Lewis</a>, of what is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_County">Roanoke County</a>, was built west of the town in 1752. Salem's Andrew Lewis Middle School was named after General Lewis. Salem became a small settlement serving travelers on the Great Road (roughly the same path followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-11">US-11</a> and later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_81">Interstate 81</a> today) and was officially founded in 1802, receiving its charter in 1806.  It is not known why the town was named Salem; the most widely accepted explanation is that it was named to honor William Bryan, a prominent citizen, who had moved from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_New_Jersey">Salem, New Jersey</a>. Salem was attacked twice by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a>, but its Salem Flying Artillery is said to have fired the last Confederate shot at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appomattox_Court_House">Appomattox Court House</a> prior to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s surrender.  One of the cityâ€™s four elementary schools is named after African American scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Carver">G.W. Carver</a>. Before integration, this was the high school for African Americans in Salem.  </p>
