<p>Nestled in the mountains of Southwest Virginia, Craig County was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Craig_(representative)">Robert Craig</a>, a 19th-century Virginia congressman. Formed from Botetourt, Roanoke, Giles, and Monroe (in present-day West Virginia) Counties in 1851, it was enlarged with several subsequent additions from neighboring counties. The secluded, mountainous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Castle,_Virginia">New Castle</a> community, the county seat, features one of the commonwealth&#39;s antebellum court complexes, including a porticoed courthouse built in 1851. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Healing_Springs">Craig Healing Springs</a>, a collection of well-preserved early-20th-century resort buildings representative of the architecture of Virginia's more modest mountain spas, is located here.  </p>
