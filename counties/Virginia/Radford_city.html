<p>Radford was named for Dr. John B. Radford..</ref> Dr. Radford's home <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnheim_(Radford,_Virginia)">Arnheim</a> was listed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2002. Radford was originally a small village of people that gathered near the New River, which was a major draw to travelers for fresh water and food while traveling west.  The town had a major population increase in 1854 when the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad came through.  A large depot was placed at Lovely Mount because of its strategic positioning between the eastern and western parts of the state.  The actual station was not on Lovely Mountain, located on the southwestern side of town, but Lovely Mount was a known mountain and naming the station this would help people to remember the location of the depot.  The Railroad Depot caused the population of Radford to boom.  It also caused a major increase in the amount of trade and business in the area.  Radford became a railroad town.  The original name for Radford was Lovely Mount because of the location of the depot; the name was changed in 1891 to Radford. Radford, or at least the train station area, was called Central Depot because of its central location halfway between Lynchburg and Bristol, Virginia of the original railroad, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (later the Norfolk and Western Railway).  </p>
