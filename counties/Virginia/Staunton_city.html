<p>The area was first settled in 1732 by John Lewis and family. In 1736, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Beverley">William Beverley</a>, a wealthy planter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merchant">merchant</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_Virginia">Essex County</a>, was granted by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown">Crown</a> over 118,000 acres (478&nbsp;kmÂ²) in what would become Augusta County. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surveying">Surveyor</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lewis_(Virginia)">Thomas Lewis</a> in 1746 laid out the first town <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plat">plat</a> for Beverley of what was originally called Beverley's Mill Place. Founded in 1747, it was renamed in honor of Lady Rebecca Staunton, wife to Royal Lieutenant-Governor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Gooch,_1st_Baronet">Sir William Gooch</a>. Because the town was located at the geographical center of the colony (which then included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia">West Virginia</a>), Staunton served between 1738 and 1771 as regional capital for what was known as the Northwest Territory, with the westernmost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courthouse">courthouse</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_North_America">British North America</a> prior to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">Revolution</a>. By 1760, Staunton was one of the major "remote trading centers in the backcountry" which coordinated the transportation of the vast amounts of grain and tobacco then being produced in response to the change of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain">Britain</a> from a net exporter of produce to an importer.  Staunton thus played a crucial role in the mid 18th century expansion of the economies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonies">American Colonies</a> which, in turn, contributed to the success of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">American Revolution</a>. It served as capital of Virginia in June 1781, when state <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly">legislators</a> fled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia">Richmond</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia">Charlottesville</a> to avoid capture by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people">British</a>.  </p>
