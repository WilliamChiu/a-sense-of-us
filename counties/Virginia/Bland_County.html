<p>The push to create Bland County resulted from popular dissatisfaction with the distances required to travel to the various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/county_seat">county seat</a>s in the area. The distances and the difficult mountain trails created a significant hardship for those needing to conduct legal affairs. In addition, the growing population resented paying taxes for benefits outside of the local area. This pressure eventually persuaded the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> to take action to form a new county in the southwestern portion of the state.  </p>
