<p>On January 2, 1786, Russell County was established from a section of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_County,_Virginia">Washington County</a>. L.P. Summers, a Washington County historian later wrote, "Washington County lost a great extent of country and many valuable citizens when Russell County was formed." The county was named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpeper_County,_Virginia">Culpeper County</a> native Colonel William Russell. The first court met in May 1786 in the Castle's Woods settlement (present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlewood,_Virginia">Castlewood</a>) in the house of William Robinson. Later, a new place was built to house the County Seat. The structure used as a courthouse still stands, and is referred to as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Russell_County_Courthouse">The Old Courthouse</a>." The present Courthouse, located in Lebanon, has been in use since 1874.  </p>
