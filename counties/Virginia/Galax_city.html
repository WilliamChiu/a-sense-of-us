<p>Galax was founded along the watercourse of Chesnut Creek which has provided an abundant water supply for the city as well as furnishing an early source of power.  The Norfolk and Western Railway extended a spur into the village, then called Blairs, with the first train arriving in 1904.  The town itself was incorporated in 1906. It was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galax">Galax</a>, an evergreen plant growing in the area. The railroad provided both freight and passenger transportation that facilitated the growth of industry and provided many of the necessities of life for the people.  The manufacture of furniture, textiles, mirrors, garments, and hardwood flooring formed the economic backbone for the area.  The processing of condensed milk also enabled many small farms to sell limited quantities of milk that were processed in Galax.  </p>
