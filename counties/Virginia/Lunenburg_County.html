<p>Lunenburg County was established on May 1, 1746, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_County,_Virginia">Brunswick County</a>. The county is named for the former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg">Duchy of Brunswick-Lunenburg</a> in Germany, because one of the titles also carried by Britain's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Hanover">Hanoverian</a> kings was Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburg.  It is nicknamed "The Old Free State" because during the buildup of the Civil War, it let Virginia know the county would break off if the state did not join The Confederacy.  </p>
