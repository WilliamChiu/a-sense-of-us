<p>The town first called Big Lick was established in 1852 and chartered in 1874.  It was named for a large outcropping of salt which drew the wildlife to the site near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_River">Roanoke River</a>.  In 1882 it became the town of Roanoke, and in 1884 it was chartered as the independent city of Roanoke.  The name ''Roanoke'' is said to have originated from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages">Algonquian</a> word for shell "money".  This was also the name of the river that bisected it (probably where shells had come from) and the county.  The city grew frequently through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation">annexation</a> through the middle of the twentieth century. The last annexation was in 1976.  The state legislature has since prohibited cities from annexing land from adjacent counties.  Roanoke's location in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a>, in the middle of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_Valley">Roanoke Valley</a> between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, made it the transportation hub of western Virginia and contributed to its rapid growth.  </p>
