<p>The town first called Big Lick was established in 1852 and chartered in 1874.  It was named for a large outcropping of salt which drew the wildlife to the site near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_River">Roanoke River</a>.  In 1882 it became the town of Roanoke, and in 1884 it was chartered as the independent city of Roanoke.  The name ''Roanoke'' is said to have originated from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages">Algonquian</a> word for shell "money".  This was also the name of the river that bisected it (probably where shells had come from) and the county.  The city grew frequently through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation">annexation</a> through the middle of the twentieth century. The last annexation was in 1976.  The state legislature has since prohibited cities from annexing land from adjacent counties.
