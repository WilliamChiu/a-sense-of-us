The term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pocosin">pocosin</a>, with its varied spellings, was a term used by the area's inhabitants to describe a low, marshy, woody place covered by water in the winter, but dry in the summer. These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">Native Americans</a> were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_peoples">Algonquians</a>, a tribal group affiliated through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powhatan_Confederacy">Powhatan Confederacy</a>, and were hostile to the early settlers. A petition to have the name of the parish and river changed was an attempt to rid the language of all vestiges of Indian terms. However, "poquoson" has survived through the centuries and has become a proper noun used to designate the present city.  </p>
