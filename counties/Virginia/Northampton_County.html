The former name of the county was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accomac_Shire">Accomac Shire</a>, one of the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shires_of_Virginia">shires of Virginia</a>.  In 1642, the name was changed to Northampton County by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England">English</a>, to eliminate "heathen" names in the New World. (In England, "shires" and "counties" were the same thing). In 1663, Northampton County was split into two counties that still exist today. The northern two thirds took the original Accomac name, while the southern third remained as Northampton.  </p>
