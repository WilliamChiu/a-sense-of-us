<p>Mille Lacs County was organized on May 23, 1857, cleaving off the easternmost portion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benton_County,_Minnesota">Benton County, Minnesota</a>.  The original Mille Lacs County consisted of the portion of the contemporary Mille Lacs County east of the west branch of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_River">Rum River</a> and two townships now part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isanti_County,_Minnesota">Isanti County</a>, adjacent to Mille Lacs County.  In 1858, the 12 townships forming the contemporary southern 10 townships of Mille Lacs County and the 2 northwestern townships in Isanti County were organized apart from either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benton_County,_Minnesota">Benton</a> or Mille Lacs County to form '''Monroe County''', leaving the northern "Square Top-knot" as the Mille Lacs County.  In 1860, Monroe and Mille Lacs Counties merged.  Shortly thereafter, the two southeastern townships were transferred to Isanti County, forming the contemporary boundaries for the county.  </p>
