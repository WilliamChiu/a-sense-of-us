<p>The area that is currently Stearns County was formerly occupied by numerous indigenous tribes, such as the Sioux (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux">Dakota</a>), Chippewa (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a>) and Winnebago (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho-chunk">Ho-chunk</a>). The first large immigration was of German Catholics in the 1850s. Early arrivals also came from eastern states. Originally, the county was supposed to be named Stevens County after Governor Isaac Ingalls Stevens who conducted an area expedition in 1853. However, due to a clerical error, the county was named Stearns after Charles Thomas Stearns who was a member of the Territorial Council.  (Later, the area two counties west was named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens_County,_Minnesota">Stevens County</a>, to compensate for this clerical error.)  </p>
