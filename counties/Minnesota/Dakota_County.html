<p>In the 1600s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdewakanton">Mdewakanton</a> Dakota fled their ancestral home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Lacs_Lake">Mille Lacs Lake</a> in northern Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibway">Ojibway</a> nation. According to Dakota tradition, their ancestors pushed out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_tribe">Iowa</a> who were found settled at the mouth of the Minnesota River. Later in 1680, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdewakanton">Mdewakanton</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux">Dakota</a> were contacted by French <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/explorer">explorer</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Greysolon,_Sieur_du_Lhut">Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut</a> and the Mendota (''mdo-TE'') band of the Mdewakanton south of the Minnesota River were contacted later by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Nicollet">Joseph Nicollet</a> in the 18th century. While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoyateduta">Taoyateduta</a> (a.k.a. Little Crow) led the Mendota in northern Dakota County, upstream to the southwest, Chief Black Dog established his village of 600 people around 1750 at the isthmus between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Valley_National_Wildlife_Refuge#Black_Dog_Preserve">Black Dog Lake</a> (from which is named after him) and the Minnesota River, near the present site of the Black Dog Power Plant.  </p>
