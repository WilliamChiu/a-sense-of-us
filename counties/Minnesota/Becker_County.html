<p>Becker County became a county on March 18, 1858. It was named after Brigadier General George Loomis Becker (1829-1904). Becker was one of three men elected to congress when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota">Minnesota</a> became a state, but since Minnesota could only send two, Becker elected to stay behind, and he was promised to have a county named after him.  </p>
