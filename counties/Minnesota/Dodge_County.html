<p>Dodge County was originally inhabited by American Indians, as many counties in Minnesota were. This area was a common hunting and battle ground for the Mdewakanton <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux">Sioux</a>, often fighting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk_people">Sauk</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Indians">Fox Indians</a> who had wandered into their territory. The first white person to visit Dodge County, however, is not known. It is believed by some that a French fur trader from Canada was the first, setting foot on its soil in the spring of 1655. Guides deemed this area unsafe due to the Natives living there. But, it was not until over two hundred years later that the locality truly came to life.  </p>
