<p>Four years before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota">Minnesota</a> was admitted to the Union as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, Houston County was chartered after its division from the eastern half of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillmore_County,_Minnesota">Fillmore County</a> on April 4, 1854. The county seat was the village of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston,_Minnesota">Houston</a> for a few years, but the county board moved the official records to Caledonia for safe storage in the cabin of Commissioner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_McPhail">Samuel McPhail</a>. The first court hearings were held in that cabin, and a one-story courthouse and jail was built in Caledonia in 1857. Turmoil over the county seat continued, a two-story building was built in Caledonia in 1867, and several referenda allowed Caledonia to prevail as the county seat by 1874. From that point on, Caledonia prospered, and Houston slowly diminished. The only other area of prominence was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Crescent,_Minnesota">La Crescent</a>, which benefited from its connection to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Crosse,_Wisconsin">La Crosse, Wisconsin</a>.  </p>
