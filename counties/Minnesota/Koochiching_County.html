<p>Historymakers of Koochiching County were of many occupations. They were explorers, traders, homesteaders, and lumberjacks. They also were teachers, preachers, merchants, engineers, and builders of industry. Settlers came at the beginning of the 1900s and suffered through isolation, illness, harsh weather, and poverty. They built schools, churches, and good roads. Koochiching County is the second largest county in area next to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Minnesota">Saint Louis County</a>. It is also one of the youngest counties in the state having been created in 1906 after it was separated from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itasca_County,_Minnesota">Itasca County</a>.  The name "Koochiching" comes from either the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe_language">Ojibwe</a> word ''Gojijiing'' or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cree_language">Cree</a> ''Kocicīhk'' (recorded in some documents as "Ouchichiq"), both meaning "at the place of inlets," referring to the neighboring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_Lake">Rainy Lake</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_River_(Minnesota-Ontario)">River</a>. Reverend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Gilfillan">J.A. Gilfillan</a> recorded their meaning, "according to some, Neighbor lake, according to others a lake somewhere," possibly referring to the neighbouring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_Lake">Rainy Lake</a> and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Couchiching">Lake Couchiching</a> located in southern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario">Ontario</a>. Early European (French) inhabitants gave the names ''Lac à la Pluie'' (Rainy Lake) and ''Rivière à la Pluie'' (Rainy River) to the nearby bodies of water because of the mist-like rain present at the falls of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_River_(Minnesota–Ontario)">Rainy River</a> and then to the settlement that became known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Falls">International Falls</a>. About 10,000 years ago almost 90% of Koochiching County was covered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Agassiz">Lake Agassiz</a>. When it receded it left low areas of decayed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vegetation">vegetation</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muskeg">muskeg</a>); as a result, three-quarters of northern Koochiching are underlain with 2 to 50 feet of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peat">peat</a>.  </p>
