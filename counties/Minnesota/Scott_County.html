<p>Scott County was established and organized by an Act passed in the legislature on March 5, 1853. The 369 sqmi county was named after General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfield_Scott">Winfield Scott</a>. Settlers started entering the area in the mid-1850s. The Minnesota River and the ox cart trails were the primary transportation routes. The first settlers were Yankees, followed by groups of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans">Germans</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people">Irish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechs">Czechs</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>ns. They each brought their own traditions and religions. Most of these settlers became farmers. Fur trading, lumbering, and farming were Minnesota's major industries all throughout the 19th century. With the fast-growing farms, sprang up towns. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakopee">Shakopee</a>, the County Seat, began in 1851 as a trading post by the Dakota Village of Chief Shakopee (or Shakpay). Other towns were established alongside transportation routes. When the railroads came to Minnesota they became the primary mode of transportation and eventually highways were developed along the ox cart trails between the communities.  </p>
