<p>John Murrell moved his family from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas">Arkansas</a> to the Flat Lick Bayou area about 6 miles west of present-day Homer in 1818, and they became the first known non-natives to permanently settle in Claiborne Parish.  As more settlers moved into the area, the Murrell house served as a church, school and post office.  When the state legislature created Claiborne Parish out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchitoches_Parish,_Louisiana">Natchitoches Parish</a> in 1828, all governmental business, including court, began being held in the Murrell house.  This continued until the new parish's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/police_jury">police jury</a> selected Russellville (now a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghost_town">ghost town</a> located northeast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Louisiana">Athens</a>) as the parish seat.  As the population began swelling in what was then the western part of the parish, the seat was moved to Overton (another modern ghost town found near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minden,_Louisiana">Minden</a>) in 1836, because of its position at the head of the navigable portion of Dorcheat Bayou. Due to flooding and health concerns, the parish seat was moved to Athens in 1846, but in 1848 fire destroyed the courthouse and all the records in it.  Soon thereafter the Claiborne Police Jury chose the present site for the parish seat, which came to be named, Homer.  </p>
