<p>Tensas Parish was the home to many succeeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</a> groups in the thousands of years before European settlements began. Village and mound sites once built by these peoples have now become archaeological sites. One example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowery_Mound">Flowery Mound</a>, a rectangular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/platform_mound">platform mound</a> just east of St. Joseph measuring 10 ft in height and 165 ft by 130 ft at its base and a summit measuring 50 ft square. Core samples taken during investigations at the site have revealed the mound was built in a single stage and because the fill types can still be differentiated it suggests the mound is relatively young. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal found in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midden">midden</a> under the mound reveals that the site was occupied from 996–1162 during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Creek_culture">Coles Creek period</a>. The mound was built over the midden between 1200–1541 during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaquemine_culture">Plaquemine</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippian_culture">Mississippian period</a>. The corners are oriented in the cardinal directions. Several others include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Mounds">Balmoral Mounds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Site_Mounds">Ghost Site Mounds</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_Mounds">Sundown Mounds</a>.  </p>
