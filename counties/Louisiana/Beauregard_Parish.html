<p>Until 1762, the land that would eventually become Beauregard Parish was a part of the Spanish holdings in Louisiana, as, at that time, the border between Spain and France was acknowledged as the Rio Hondo( now Calcasieu) river, however the land between the Rio Hondo and the Sabine river was in some dispute as the French were beginning to occupy land on the west side of the Rio Hondo.  In 1762, the king of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</a> secretly gave Louisiana to Spain in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fontainebleau_(1762)">Treaty of Fontainebleau</a>.  From 1762 to until 1800, the region was a part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_(New_Spain)">New Spain</a>.  In 1800, the secret <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso">Third Treaty of San Ildefonso</a> transferred possession of Louisiana back to the French, although Spain continued to administer the land.  In this period, the only European settlers to the land that would become Beauregard Parish were a few individuals with Spanish land grants.    </p>
