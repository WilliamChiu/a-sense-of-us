<p>Originally a part of Catahoula and Ouachita parishes, Caldwell Parish was established within its present boundaries on March 6, 1838, with earlier settlements recorded to have been made soon after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Columbia, the parish seat, was founded in 1827, at a natural crossing on the Ouachita Riverâ€”a river with a national reputation for its natural beauty. The Ouachita divides the parish into delta farmland and wetlands on the east, and piney woods hill country on the west. In the 1800s, Columbia became a steamboat town for the transport of timber staves and cotton. Forestry and agriculture are still the prominent industries in the parish.  </p>
