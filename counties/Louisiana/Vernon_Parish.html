<p>On March 30, 1871, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_Legislature">General Assembly</a> passed an act designating the creation of Vernon Parish, by taking territory from the parishes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchitoches_Parish,_Louisiana">Natchitoches</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapides_Parish,_Louisiana">Rapides</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_Parish,_Louisiana">Sabine</a>. While there seem to be four stories surrounding the naming of the Parish, only one is affirmed officially by the State which is that it was named in honor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon_(plantation)">Mt. Vernon</a>, the home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a>.  Other stories, though folklore, are: 1) that it was named after a race horse owned by Joe Moore, one of the members of the committee chosen to name the parish, who claimed that by naming the parish after his fast horse the committee would insure the growth of the parish to be as fast as his horse:  2) that it was named after a popular teacher who had been an officer in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal Navy</a>, only mentioned as "Mr. Vernon".  This was not to honor him, but to avoid disputes among the parish founders whom each wanted to name the parish after themselves. The final story is similar to the first and claims that the committee had been arguing over the name while drinking in a store, and in an attempt to preserve his precious whiskey and profits, the host suggested the committee stop a local man with a mule pulling a cart and that they should name the parish whatever the man said.  The man answered them "I calls him Vernon, 'cause he's the fastes' mule in de country."  Originally the area comprising Vernon was a part of a tract of land that was in dispute between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a>, this land was called the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Strip_(Louisiana)">Neutral Strip</a>". As a result of this dispute the area became a haven for outlaws. Prior to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> in 1803, the only persons who came to the area were a few French and Spanish settlers.  It was also during this period that Dr. Burr established the community of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_Ferry">Burr Ferry</a>.  This community was known as the "Gateway to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</a>". Also located near this community, there still stands an artillery site (now called the "Confederate Breast Works"), which was manned by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America">Confederacy</a> to guard against Union movements along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Trace">Nolan Trace</a> during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a>.  </p>
