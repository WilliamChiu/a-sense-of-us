<p>St. Bernard Parish contains a large community of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spanish</a> descent. Sometimes referred to informally as "Spanish Cajuns", the ''<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isleño_Americans">Isleños</a>'' are descended from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canarian_people">Canary Islanders</a>.  This linguistically isolated group eventually developed its own dialect.  This settlement was first called ''La Concepcion'' and ''Nueva Galvez'' by Spanish officials, but was later renamed ''Terre aux Boeufs''  ("boeuf" = "beef") (French) and ''Tierra de Bueyes'' (Spanish) for "land of cattle", because nearby areas were used for cattle grazing.  '''Saint Bernard''', the patron saint of colonial governor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_de_Galvez">Bernardo de Galvez</a>, was used in documents to identify  the area.  </p>
