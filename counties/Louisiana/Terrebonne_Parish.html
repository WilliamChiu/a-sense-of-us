The native word ''houma'' means red, and the tribe's war emblem was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crawfish">crawfish</a>. Historians say the Houma were related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskogean">Muskogean</a>-speaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, and migrated into the area from present-day Mississippi and Alabama. They first settled near what is now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge">Baton Rouge</a>. After many conflicts with other Indian tribes, and losing a war to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_people">Tunica</a> in 1706, to escape the encroachment of Europeans, the Houma Indians continued moving south to more remote areas in the bayous. They settled in present-day Terrebonne Parish in the mid to late eighteenth century. They established a camp known as Ouiski Bayou on the high ground northwest of what later developed as downtown Houma. They were subsequently pushed from the highlands of the north to the coastal regions of the south by the European settlements in the late 1700s and 1800s. Evidence of the Houma Tribe can still be found in this area today.  </p>
