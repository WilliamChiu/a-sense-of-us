<p>Butler County was formed on January 15, 1851 from open land. It was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky">Kentucky</a> native <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Orlando_Butler">William Orlando Butler</a>, a general and hero of the Mexicanâ€“American War, who ran as Vice President of the United States in 1848. Until 1854, the county was governed by other counties.  Only at this time did it have enough inhabitants to establish its own local government. The first court proceedings were conducted in a small log cabin of a settler.  In 1858, the first courthouse was completed in Clarksville.  After it was sold shortly thereafter to the local school district, it was used as a schoolhouse from 1863 until 1903.  </p>
