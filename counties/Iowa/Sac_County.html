<p>Sac County was formed on January 15, 1851.  It was named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk_people">Sauk people</a>, formerly referred to as the Sac Indians. Sac City was appointed the county seat in 1856, and the first Sac County Courthouse was erected in 1862. The courthouse served its purpose well until 1873 when citizens of Sac County realized the county had outgrown the tiny building. Thus, a second courthouse was built. The building was eighty-five feet by fifty-six feet, a beautiful building of brick with limestone foundations and an impressive tower on the top. It was declared to be one of the best county buildings in Iowa. This courthouse was first used in January 1874, and the old courthouse was sold shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, in 1888 a prisoner set fire to the jail attached to the courthouse while attempting to escape, and both buildings were destroyed. Sac City erected a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sac_County_Courthouse">third courthouse</a> at a cost of thirty thousand dollars. This courthouse has been in use since with minimal structural changes, except for an extensive addition which was completed in the 1980s.  </p>
