<p>Linn County was organized by the first legislative assembly of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa">Iowa Territory</a> on January 15, 1839. A site was selected for its first county seat along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Creek_(Cedar_Rapids,_Iowa)">Indian Creek</a>, and was named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion,_IA">Marion</a>, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">Revolutionary War</a> general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Marion">Francis Marion</a>. As early as 1855, there were debates over moving the county seat to the fast-growing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Rapids">Cedar Rapids</a>, southwest of Marion, but it was not until November 6, 1919, that there were enough votes in favor of the move (9,960 to 4,823). The first rail line was built through Cedar Rapids in 1859, and made the town (and the county) a major commercial hub in eastern Iowa.  </p>
