<p>The land that now forms Dallas County was ceded by the Sac and Fox nation to the United States in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Beach">treaty signed on October 11, 1842</a>, and the county was formed in 1846.  In 1847 the first pioneers selected a site for the county seat, which was first called ''Penoach'' and then later Adel.  Once the prairie sod was "broken" by the agricultural plow, settlement was rapid in the 1850s and 1860s, with the population crossing the 12,000 mark by 1870.  </p>
