<p>Mecklenburg County was formed in 1762 from the western part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anson_County,_North_Carolina">Anson County</a>. It was named in commemoration of the marriage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom">King George III</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a>, for whom the county seat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina"> Charlotte</a> is named. Due to unsure boundaries, a large part of south and western Mecklenburg County extended into areas that would later form part of the state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</a>. In 1768, most of this area (the part of Mecklenburg County west of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catawba_River">Catawba River</a>) was designated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryon_County,_North_Carolina">Tryon County</a>, North Carolina. Determining the final boundaries of these "western" areas between North and South Carolina was a decades-long process. In 1792 the northeastern part of Mecklenburg County was taken for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabarrus_County,_North_Carolina">Cabarrus County</a>. Finally, in 1842 the southeastern part of Mecklenburg County was combined with the western part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anson_County,_North_Carolina">Anson County</a> to become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_North_Carolina">Union County</a>.  </p>
