The first settlers came to the region in the mid-1720s, and were followed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Scots">Highland Scots</a> immigrants.  The Scots settled in the foothills, where land was more affordable, rather than in the rich alluvial soil area of the coastal plain. After the defeat by the British of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart">Bonny Prince Charles</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden">Culloden</a>, Scots immigrants came up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fear_River">Cape Fear River</a> in ever increasing numbers and settled in western Harnett County.  British immigrants had settled primarily along the banks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fear_River">Cape Fear River</a> in the coastal area, generally from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin,_North_Carolina">Erwin</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina">Wilmington</a>.  </p>
